        "## Recommender Systems\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, I developed a sophisticated recommender system using a dataset of approximately 1950 articles scraped from various news sources. The objective was to create a personalized news recommendation engine utilizing three different approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Content-Based Filtering**: This method recommends articles similar to a given article by analyzing the content and computing similarity scores using word embeddings. It focuses on the attributes of the articles themselves to find similarities.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Collaborative Filtering**: This approach generates recommendations based on user interactions and preferences. To simulate real-world user behavior, we created a user profile by selecting random topics for a user and designating these topics as their preferences. Articles were served based on these preferences, with clicks determined by a binomial distribution (click probability = 0.7). The time spent on each article was randomly decided, and ratings were assigned based on the time spent. Additionally, some articles outside the user's preferred topics were served with a lower click probability (0.1). This simulated scenario provided realistic data for evaluating the collaborative filtering approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Hybrid Recommender System**: To leverage the strengths of both content-based and collaborative filtering, I implemented a hybrid recommendation system. This system combines the content-based similarity scores with the collaborative filtering rankings to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hybrid approach integrates the advantages of both methods, offering a balanced and enhanced recommendation system. This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of different recommendation techniques, showcasing their individual and combined capabilities in delivering personalized content to users."

              "0  Growing up in the small community of Harrow in southern Australia, 86-year-old Lachie Turner spent his childhood hearing legends of the great Aboriginal cricketer Johnny Mullagh. \"The story used to be that he could win a match, batting with just the handle of a pickaxe,\" said Turner, with a smile. Mullagh was a hero in Harrow, and the surrounding livestock communities, where homesteads dot the landscape along miles of single-lane dirt roads. At a time when being Indigenous meant you could be thrown off your land, forced into Christian missions or even shot, Mullagh -- of the Jardwadjali people from western Victoria -- grew from being a farmhand on a local estate to a world-famous cricket player. Yet until recently, most Australians didn't know Mullagh's story, or anything about the journey that took him and 12 Aboriginal cricketers from farmsteads in Victoria, to Melbourne, Sydney and then, finally, England in 1868 -- making them Australia's first sporting team to play overseas. But when the Aboriginal cricket team returned in 1869, their achievements couldn't save them from the institutional racism shown by colonizers towards First Nations people. Most of the team were immediately placed in missions, away from their communities and their homes. When they died some were buried in unmarked graves. They were never paid for their historic tour. Now, more than a century later, Australia's cricketing bodies are seeking to give the Indigenous team the recognition they deserve. The team is increasingly referred to as \"Australia's First XI,\" a term usually reserved for a region's best cricket line-up. On the 150th anniversary of their England tour in 2018, an all-Indigneous team was sent to the UK in their honor -- with each young player taking the name of one of Australia's First XI. Last December, Mullagh, whose Aboriginal name was Unaarrimin, was inducted into Australia's cricketing Hall of Fame and a medal created in his honor. Paul Stewart, deputy chief executive of Australia's Lowitja Institute and a Taungurung man from central Victoria, said he felt both \"pride and sadness\" when he thought of the story of Australia's First XI, and what they accomplished. \"Off field it was a sad story, on the field it's a bloody ripper of a story,\" he said. Colonization All but two of the members of the First XI came from the same region in western Victoria, which had been home to Australia's Indigenous people for tens of thousands of years. Some were part of the last generation to live in Australia before the white colonizers drove them off their land and destroyed their way of life. Yanggendyinanyuk, also known as Dick-A-Dick, who played in the England tour, was born in the 1830s, and for about the first 10 years of his life he lived on the land with his people, the Wotjobaluk, according to his great-great-grandson Richard Kennedy. Yanggendyinanyuk was a child when large numbers of white settlers began to arrive in the region. The colonists pushed Aboriginal people off their land and depleted or wiped out their traditional sources of food. In 1866, local newspaper the Hamilton Spectator published a letter from one settler boasting how he and other landholders had, in the past five years, killed more than 150,000 kangaroos, which they viewed as pests that ate grass needed for livestock. Native grains and vegetables were destroyed by the hooves of European cattle. Without their traditional food sources, Kennedy said some Aboriginal people began to take sheep from farms. If caught, they and their families could be shot. The University of Newcastle's map of colonial frontier massacres in Australia -- still incomplete -- records 56 massacres of over 1,200 Aboriginal people by colonizers in what is now the state of Victoria. The atrocities that have recorded so far occurred in that region between 1834 and 1859. Indigenous communities never recovered fully from colonization. Today, Kennedy said that he is one of about 10 people who can speak the Wotjobaluk language. In an attempt to stay on their land, some Indigenous Australians worked on the farms and homesteads which were sprouting up across western Victoria during this period, according to Josie Sangster, curator at the Harrow Discovery Center. They were given food and board by the white settlers but weren't paid. Among those station hands was Mullagh. Little is known about his early years, except that he was born in 1843 and in the early 1860s worked mostly on two stations -- Pine Hills and Mullagh -- where he got his name, according to Sangster. Kennedy's ancestor, Yanggendyinanyuk, worked at Mt Elgin station for a time as a boundary rider, the worker responsible for checking and patrolling perimeter fences. In their spare time on these stations, White Australian farmers would play cricket to unwind. And slowly, they began to teach their Aboriginal workers the game. Humble beginnings The western Victorian farmers weren't the first settlers to teach their Aboriginal workers how to play cricket. In their book Cricket Walkabout, which tells the story of Australia's First XI, Rex Harcourt and John Mulvaney give examples of Aboriginal cricket players from as far back as the early 1850s. But none achieved the success of the team from western Victoria. Sangster said homestead owners around Harrow quickly noticed their Aboriginal workers had a natural talent for cricket. Soon, landholders started talking about forming an all-Indigenous cricket team to play the local White farmers. Mullagh was selected with one of the homesteaders, William Hayman, as team manager. In January 1866, less than a year after coming together, the Aboriginals played against a team of White players from Edenhope -- and won. Hayman then took the team south to the regional hub of Hamilton, where they thrashed the local club 123 runs to 66, according to Cricket Walkabout. Mullagh alone took five wickets. \"Within a couple of years they were beating teams, people who had played cricket all their lives,\" said Kennedy. Word spread of the Aboriginal team's success, partly thanks to canny marketing by Hayman who, according to Mulvaney and Harcourt, sent photographs of the Indigenous team in their uniforms to his cricketing contacts in Melbourne. After a handful of wins in rural Victoria, the Indigenous players were invited to appear in Melbourne on Boxing Day, at one of Australia's most prestigious venues -- the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Hayman hired sportsman Tom Wills to coach the team for the big match. Wills was known for his prowess in cricket and rugby, and would go on to co-found the Australian Football League, or Aussie Rules. The composition of the team changed during the first season. A photograph from the Melbourne Cricket Ground in December 1866 shows Mullagh, as well as Kennedy's ancestor Yanggendyinanyuk, who Sangster said joined the team sometime that year, after other players fell sick while traveling between towns. Five others in the photo were also part of the England tour, including Zellanach, Bripumyarrimin, Brimbunyah, Bullchanach and Arrahmunyjarrimin. Like Mullagh and Yanggendyinanyuk, all five had been previously given English names -- Johnny Cuzens, King Cole, Redcap, Bullocky and Peter. On Boxing Day, the Aboriginals lost to the top local team at the Melbourne Cricket Club, but in other ways the match was a massive success. An article in Melbourne newspaper The Age the next day estimated that about 10,000 people had watched the game, a remarkable turnout given the population of Melbourne in 1861 was only about 140,000. It was seen as something of a spectacle at the time. \"It was quite manifest throughout the play that the sympathies of the public were enlisted on the side of the Aboriginals,\" the article from The Age said. Businessman W.E.B. Gurnett, who saw the team play at the Boxing Day test, took a close interest in the team -- and their potential profitability. He convinced Hayman and Wills to take them on a tour of Victoria and New South Wales. Gurnett said there was even the possibility for a tour to England. The five-month Australia tour began in Melbourne in January 1867, and went more or less without incident until it reached Sydney in March, where it all rapidly fell apart. Harrow Discovery Center's Sangster said that Gurnett ran off with all the money earned from ticket sales and left Wills, Hayman and the Aboriginal cricketers stranded. During their time in Sydney, the team had stayed at a pub at Manly Beach, in Sydney, named the Pier Hotel, which was owned by Charles Lawrence, an old friend of Wills. Lawrence was a former cricketer who played in the English team's first tour of Australia in 1861-62. When Lawrence's teammates returned to England, he stayed behind to \"lift the level of cricket in Australia,\" according to his great-great-grandson Ian Friend. He took a liking to the Aboriginal cricket team and, along with two Sydney businessmen, George Graham and George Smith, offered to help finance a tour of England for the Aboriginal team -- provided Lawrence coached them. Going 'fishing' There is one glaring gap in the story of Australia's First XI -- almost no record exists of what the Aboriginal players thought of their journey. None of the players wrote letters, or at least any that have survived, and even the few who had sporting careers after the tour didn't speak at length about their experiences. Much of what is known of the Aboriginal cricket team's almost two year-long tour of Victoria, New South Wales and then England is recorded by Lawrence, their White coach, in his memoirs, and press clippings in Australian and English papers. Kennedy said he had no idea what his great-great-grandfather thought of his role in Australia's sporting history, a fact which he finds deeply sad. There is no record of how the cricketers felt about being smuggled out of Victoria to begin their tour. In the late 1860s, the Victorian board tasked with managing the local Aboriginal population ruled the team couldn't leave the colony to play a game in the neighboring state of New South Wales. No reason was given why. The men were adults at the time, Mullagh was about 27 and Kennedy's ancestor, Yanggendyinanyuk, was about 35, according to the Australian Dictionary of Biography. Harrow's Sangster said the board was likely concerned the Indigenous men would pick up potentially deadly diseases, a justified fear given several players became ill during the initial tour in 1866 and 1867. Lawrence decided to take them anyway. Lawrence smuggled the cricket team out on a boat from the Victorian city of Queenscliff, secretly sailing north to New South Wales to continue to the tour under the alibi of taking them out on a \"fishing\" trip. The Englishman's great-great-grandson, Friend, said Lawrence had a genuine affection for the players. \"(He) loved these guys, wanted to teach them how to play, and t   \n",

              "      <td>Growing up in the small community of Harrow in southern Australia, 86-year-old Lachie Turner spent his childhood hearing legends of the great Aboriginal cricketer Johnny Mullagh. \"The story used to be that he could win a match, batting with just the handle of a pickaxe,\" said Turner, with a smile. Mullagh was a hero in Harrow, and the surrounding livestock communities, where homesteads dot the landscape along miles of single-lane dirt roads. At a time when being Indigenous meant you could be thrown off your land, forced into Christian missions or even shot, Mullagh -- of the Jardwadjali people from western Victoria -- grew from being a farmhand on a local estate to a world-famous cricket player. Yet until recently, most Australians didn't know Mullagh's story, or anything about the journey that took him and 12 Aboriginal cricketers from farmsteads in Victoria, to Melbourne, Sydney and then, finally, England in 1868 -- making them Australia's first sporting team to play overseas. But when the Aboriginal cricket team returned in 1869, their achievements couldn't save them from the institutional racism shown by colonizers towards First Nations people. Most of the team were immediately placed in missions, away from their communities and their homes. When they died some were buried in unmarked graves. They were never paid for their historic tour. Now, more than a century later, Australia's cricketing bodies are seeking to give the Indigenous team the recognition they deserve. The team is increasingly referred to as \"Australia's First XI,\" a term usually reserved for a region's best cricket line-up. On the 150th anniversary of their England tour in 2018, an all-Indigneous team was sent to the UK in their honor -- with each young player taking the name of one of Australia's First XI. Last December, Mullagh, whose Aboriginal name was Unaarrimin, was inducted into Australia's cricketing Hall of Fame and a medal created in his honor. Paul Stewart, deputy chief executive of Australia's Lowitja Institute and a Taungurung man from central Victoria, said he felt both \"pride and sadness\" when he thought of the story of Australia's First XI, and what they accomplished. \"Off field it was a sad story, on the field it's a bloody ripper of a story,\" he said. Colonization All but two of the members of the First XI came from the same region in western Victoria, which had been home to Australia's Indigenous people for tens of thousands of years. Some were part of the last generation to live in Australia before the white colonizers drove them off their land and destroyed their way of life. Yanggendyinanyuk, also known as Dick-A-Dick, who played in the England tour, was born in the 1830s, and for about the first 10 years of his life he lived on the land with his people, the Wotjobaluk, according to his great-great-grandson Richard Kennedy. Yanggendyinanyuk was a child when large numbers of white settlers began to arrive in the region. The colonists pushed Aboriginal people off their land and depleted or wiped out their traditional sources of food. In 1866, local newspaper the Hamilton Spectator published a letter from one settler boasting how he and other landholders had, in the past five years, killed more than 150,000 kangaroos, which they viewed as pests that ate grass needed for livestock. Native grains and vegetables were destroyed by the hooves of European cattle. Without their traditional food sources, Kennedy said some Aboriginal people began to take sheep from farms. If caught, they and their families could be shot. The University of Newcastle's map of colonial frontier massacres in Australia -- still incomplete -- records 56 massacres of over 1,200 Aboriginal people by colonizers in what is now the state of Victoria. The atrocities that have recorded so far occurred in that region between 1834 and 1859. Indigenous communities never recovered fully from colonization. Today, Kennedy said that he is one of about 10 people who can speak the Wotjobaluk language. In an attempt to stay on their land, some Indigenous Australians worked on the farms and homesteads which were sprouting up across western Victoria during this period, according to Josie Sangster, curator at the Harrow Discovery Center. They were given food and board by the white settlers but weren't paid. Among those station hands was Mullagh. Little is known about his early years, except that he was born in 1843 and in the early 1860s worked mostly on two stations -- Pine Hills and Mullagh -- where he got his name, according to Sangster. Kennedy's ancestor, Yanggendyinanyuk, worked at Mt Elgin station for a time as a boundary rider, the worker responsible for checking and patrolling perimeter fences. In their spare time on these stations, White Australian farmers would play cricket to unwind. And slowly, they began to teach their Aboriginal workers the game. Humble beginnings The western Victorian farmers weren't the first settlers to teach their Aboriginal workers how to play cricket. In their book Cricket Walkabout, which tells the story of Australia's First XI, Rex Harcourt and John Mulvaney give examples of Aboriginal cricket players from as far back as the early 1850s. But none achieved the success of the team from western Victoria. Sangster said homestead owners around Harrow quickly noticed their Aboriginal workers had a natural talent for cricket. Soon, landholders started talking about forming an all-Indigenous cricket team to play the local White farmers. Mullagh was selected with one of the homesteaders, William Hayman, as team manager. In January 1866, less than a year after coming together, the Aboriginals played against a team of White players from Edenhope -- and won. Hayman then took the team south to the regional hub of Hamilton, where they thrashed the local club 123 runs to 66, according to Cricket Walkabout. Mullagh alone took five wickets. \"Within a couple of years they were beating teams, people who had played cricket all their lives,\" said Kennedy. Word spread of the Aboriginal team's success, partly thanks to canny marketing by Hayman who, according to Mulvaney and Harcourt, sent photographs of the Indigenous team in their uniforms to his cricketing contacts in Melbourne. After a handful of wins in rural Victoria, the Indigenous players were invited to appear in Melbourne on Boxing Day, at one of Australia's most prestigious venues -- the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Hayman hired sportsman Tom Wills to coach the team for the big match. Wills was known for his prowess in cricket and rugby, and would go on to co-found the Australian Football League, or Aussie Rules. The composition of the team changed during the first season. A photograph from the Melbourne Cricket Ground in December 1866 shows Mullagh, as well as Kennedy's ancestor Yanggendyinanyuk, who Sangster said joined the team sometime that year, after other players fell sick while traveling between towns. Five others in the photo were also part of the England tour, including Zellanach, Bripumyarrimin, Brimbunyah, Bullchanach and Arrahmunyjarrimin. Like Mullagh and Yanggendyinanyuk, all five had been previously given English names -- Johnny Cuzens, King Cole, Redcap, Bullocky and Peter. On Boxing Day, the Aboriginals lost to the top local team at the Melbourne Cricket Club, but in other ways the match was a massive success. An article in Melbourne newspaper The Age the next day estimated that about 10,000 people had watched the game, a remarkable turnout given the population of Melbourne in 1861 was only about 140,000. It was seen as something of a spectacle at the time. \"It was quite manifest throughout the play that the sympathies of the public were enlisted on the side of the Aboriginals,\" the article from The Age said. Businessman W.E.B. Gurnett, who saw the team play at the Boxing Day test, took a close interest in the team -- and their potential profitability. He convinced Hayman and Wills to take them on a tour of Victoria and New South Wales. Gurnett said there was even the possibility for a tour to England. The five-month Australia tour began in Melbourne in January 1867, and went more or less without incident until it reached Sydney in March, where it all rapidly fell apart. Harrow Discovery Center's Sangster said that Gurnett ran off with all the money earned from ticket sales and left Wills, Hayman and the Aboriginal cricketers stranded. During their time in Sydney, the team had stayed at a pub at Manly Beach, in Sydney, named the Pier Hotel, which was owned by Charles Lawrence, an old friend of Wills. Lawrence was a former cricketer who played in the English team's first tour of Australia in 1861-62. When Lawrence's teammates returned to England, he stayed behind to \"lift the level of cricket in Australia,\" according to his great-great-grandson Ian Friend. He took a liking to the Aboriginal cricket team and, along with two Sydney businessmen, George Graham and George Smith, offered to help finance a tour of England for the Aboriginal team -- provided Lawrence coached them. Going 'fishing' There is one glaring gap in the story of Australia's First XI -- almost no record exists of what the Aboriginal players thought of their journey. None of the players wrote letters, or at least any that have survived, and even the few who had sporting careers after the tour didn't speak at length about their experiences. Much of what is known of the Aboriginal cricket team's almost two year-long tour of Victoria, New South Wales and then England is recorded by Lawrence, their White coach, in his memoirs, and press clippings in Australian and English papers.

Chinese state media reported Saturday that the State Administration for Market Regulation had imposed the penalty following an antitrust investigation into Alibaba's \\\"exclusive dealing agreements\\\" that prevented merchants from selling products on rival e-commerce platforms \\u2014 a practice known as \\\"choosing one from two.\\\" The fine is equivalent to 4% of Alibaba's sales in China in 2019, state news agency Xinhua reported, and dwarfs the previous record penalty of $975 million handed out to American chipmaker Qualcomm in 2015. Beijing has been tightening the screws on China's national tech champions in recent months, part of a regulatory crackdown that President Xi Jinping has described as one of the country's top priorities for 2021. Last month, Xi urged officials to step up their efforts to regulate online companies to maintain social stability. Co-founded by legendary entrepreneur Jack Ma, Alibaba is one of China's most prominent and successful private businesses. By making such a high-profile example, Chinese regulators are sending a clear message about their intent to rein in the country's most powerful companies. Ma has kept a very low profile since Ant Group, Alibaba's financial affiliate, was forced to shelve what would have been the world's biggest IPO last November after he criticized Chinese regulators. Since then, Ma has made only one brief public appearance in a video in January, and Ant Group \\u2014 which owns the hugely popular digital payments app Alipay \\u2014 has been ordered to overhaul its business. In an open letter published on Saturday, Alibaba said the company had cooperated with the investigation and accepted the penalty \\\"with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination.\\\" \\\"Alibaba would not have achieved our growth without sound government regulation and service, and the critical oversight, tolerance and support from all of our constituencies have been crucial to our development. For this, we are full of gratitude and respect,\\\" it added. \\\"It is not lost on us that today's society has new expectations for platform companies, as we must assume more responsibilities as part of the nation's economic and social development.\\\" Beijing has long been concerned that the influence tech firms have over the financial sector makes that industry vulnerable \\u2014 Ant, for example, now commands more than half of the mobile payments market in China \\u2014 and officials have been looking for ways to rein them in. Other tech companies could be next in the firing line. Regulators have questioned executives at Tencent and Pinduoduo, punished TikTok-owner Bytedance and Baidu with fines for alleged monopolistic behaviors in corporate acquisitions, and floated new rules that could govern the operations at many tech firms. Tencent is reportedly facing scrutiny for alleged monopolistic practices at its social networking app WeChat. The company, which dominates online payments in China via WeChat Pay and owns hugely popular mobile games, said in a statement last month that a recent meeting with regulators was \\\"voluntary.\\\" \\\"Tencent has had meetings with regulators on a regular basis, and this was a regular meeting,\\\" it said. \\\"We discussed a broad range of topics, mainly focused on fostering innovation and creating a healthy environment for industry evolution. Tencent has always and will continue to conduct our operations in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.\\\" \\u2014 Laura He and Michelle Toh contributed reporting.\",\n          \"In the dead calm of a winter's night on a remote Canadian stretch of the Alaska Highway -- without another soul in sight -- the sound of something sizzling echoed down the MacDonald Valley, where Ryan Dickie had driven to photograph the northern lights. It was the evening after a particularly active display of the celebrated celestial phenomenon above Dickie's home in northern British Columbia. The 36-year-old Indigenous Dene photographer and conservationist from Canada's Fort Nelson First Nation decided to go someplace far from any light pollution to shoot what he hoped would be a similarly spectacular show in the sky. But as he stepped outside into the frozen night to adjust his camera settings, it was the sound -- not just the sight -- that stopped him in his tracks. \\\"When you're living up here you hear stories that they (the northern lights) make a sound, and if you whistle at them that they'll come closer to the ground,\\\" Dickie said. \\\"My grandma told me a story when they were kids growing up on the land near the Liard River about how the northern lights made clicking sounds, like you'd make to call your dog.\\\" But when Dickie finally heard it, it was different. \\\"It was kind of faint at first, but almost sounded like a piece of meat hitting a frying pan,\\\" Dickie said. Ears to the sky Caused by solar flares on the surface of the sun, the northern lights -- also known as the aurora borealis or an aurora -- can appear in Earth's magnetic field as faint whitish or greenish cloudlike formations or even curtains of color and swirling explosions that erupt across the sky in greens, pinks and purple. In places like Arctic Alaska, Arctic Canada, northern Norway, Finnish Lapland and other northern reaches of the planet, where they're regularly seen, there are countless reports of people hearing sounds along with the aurora, too. Mamie Williams, a member of the Tlingit tribe in Hoonah, Alaska, said that her grandmothers always told her to listen for the northern lights when she was a child. \\\"It's our ancestors letting us know, 'We crossed over but we're still here with you,'\\\" said Williams, a cultural interpreter who works with Alaska Native Voices. Williams first heard the aurora borealis make singing and crackling sounds when she was 14 years old and said she has heard it make similar noises since. Once, when the sky was vibrant with purples and greens, she said she even heard the sound of drumming accompanying the lights in the sky. \\\"The brighter they get, the more you hear,\\\" Williams said. But while accounts like those of Dickie and Williams are not unusual among both Indigenous and nonindigenous people living where the northern lights regularly can be seen, there so far has been little scientific research into the phenomenon. \\\"There's been years and years of anecdotal reporting of people hearing a whooshing or crackling sound,\\\" said Donald Hampton, a research associate professor at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who studies space physics and aurora and auroral interactions with the upper atmosphere. \\\"But if you think about it physically, there's no way you're actually getting sounds from the aurora itself.\\\" That's because the northern lights occur between 60 and 100 miles above the Earth's surface and it takes sound several seconds to travel a mile, Hampton said. \\\"If you've ever counted after a lightning strike, it takes five seconds for sound to go a mile,\\\" he said, so if sounds were coming from the northern lights themselves they would take five to 10 minutes to be heard on the ground. Still, Hampton does not discount the theory that the northern lights could be responsible for the sound people claim to hear. A theory illuminated Unto K. Laine first heard a sound accompanying the aurora borealis while visiting the remote northern Finland village of Saariselk\\u00e4 in 1990 for a jazz festival. Together with four friends, the professor emeritus in acoustics at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland, \\\"made the proposal to listen to the quietness of Lapland,\\\" he said. With the northern lights filling the sky above them, three people in his group that night heard not silence but soft sounds \\\"like bursting soap bubbles,\\\" Laine said. \\\"We really had to be very quiet over two minutes and concentrate to the listening,\\\" he said. It was an experience that never left him, Laine said, especially with all of the stories of people reporting sounds associated with the northern lights, while no scientific research was being done into the phenomenon. \\\"This question mark was permanently in my mind,\\\" said Laine, who has spent most of his career studying the phenomenon of sounds. He has a theory about what people hear and associate with the northern lights. Published in 2016, his temperature inversion layer hypothesis posits that the sound people associate with the northern lights actually comes from electric discharges at lower altitudes of around 70 and 90 meters (230 and 296 feet). Those sparks, he theorizes, emit from the aurora during calm and clear weather when a temperature inversion layer -- or a layer in the atmosphere in which the air warms with height instead of cooling with height -- is produced. \\\"In the evening of a sunny day warm air close to the ground starts to rise while the ground temperature drops. Finally, the rising of the warm air stops typically below an altitude of 100 meters (328 feet),\\\" Laine said. \\\"This layer of a warm air, having colder air above and below it, is called temperature inversion layer.\\\" Laine has spent decades recording the sounds using a three-microphone setup and a VLF (very low frequency) loop antenna connected to a four-channel digital recorder. During clear evenings, Laine said, the inversion layer accumulates space charges -- positive ones from the upper atmosphere and negative ones from the ground. The magnetic storm that is the cause of auroral lights triggers and releases these discharges in the inversion layer, producing audible sounds, he said. Hampton said that Laine's theory is \\\"not out of the realm of possibility.\\\" \\\"He's going with the assumption it has to do with electricity,\\\" Hampton said. \\\"A strong electric field could set up mechanisms by which you could get air vibrations or little discharges that could pop or snap.\\\" Research, amplified Laine's theory helped inspire a new citizen science project launching this summer near Jyv\\u00e4skyl\\u00e4, Finland, where volunteers at the Hankasalmi Observatory will begin continuously recording potential sounds associated with auroras 24 hours a day for the first time, using four microphones instead of Laine's three. The project is funded in part by the European Union as well as the support of 200 local volunteers. The hope is that the four microphones -- which can pick up the same sounds as the human ear -- will be able to pinpoint where the sounds are coming from, helping to prove or disprove Laine's theory, said Arto Oksanen, the observatory's president. \\\"We are trying to hear the same sound with three or four microphones located a few meters apart,\\\" he said. \\\"By measuring the time delay in each recording, it is possible to calculate the three-dimensional position of the sound source -- or at least the direction to the sound source.\\\" Combining that result with the electromagnetic signal measured with a VLF antenna, Oksanen said, will also give the distance of the sound source. Oksanen, who said he is \\\"open to anything and making recordings,\\\" admitted being \\\"a bit skeptical\\\" that the northern lights are producing the sounds, having spent hundreds of hours watching auroras without hearing them. \\\"There have been so many stories of people hearing the sounds, I don't think they're making it up,\\\" he said. \\\"But I don't know if it's true acoustic sounds. Nowadays, it should be very easy to record it since everyone has a phone. So why aren't there recordings?\\\" Compared to the portable setup Laine has used to make recordings so far, the observatory's setup will be permanent and \\\"allow us to collect much more data,\\\" Oksanen said. Adding an additional microphone also \\\"gives further confidence and error analysis,\\\" he said. \\\"Many universities and scientists don't believe in the sounds, and they aren't even applying for funding to make these recordings,\\\" he said. \\\"So maybe we can find something that nobody has found before.\\\" Not everyone needs a recording to be convinced the sounds exist, however. \\\"It was definitely the sound I'd always heard they made,\\\" Dickie said of the night along the Alaska Highway and the show in his sky -- and in his ears -- that he'll never forget. \\\"I was certain it was the sound of the northern lights.\\\" Top image: The aurora borealis ignites the early morning sky shortly before sunrise near Fort Nelson in northeast British Columbia, Canada.

That projection accounts for the scale up of Covid-19 vaccine distribution in the US over the next 90 days and continued spread of the B.1.1.7 virus variant throughout the nation. An April 1 forecast projected 609,000 deaths by July 1 and warned that continued relaxation of public health measures and increases in mobility could lead to large surges of cases, like those seen in Michigan. In the worst-case scenario, in which fully vaccinated people return to pre-pandemic levels of mobility, the model predicts 697,573 deaths by August 1. If 95% of the US population wore masks, the projection drops to 604,413 deaths by August 1.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cricket\",\n          \"football\",\n          \"europe\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date_pub\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 367,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sep 8, 2020\",\n          \"Jan 14, 2020\",\n          \"Aug 18, 2020\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "In this section, we delve into Content-Based Filtering techniques, a cornerstone of recommendation systems that analyze the intrinsic characteristics of items to make personalized recommendations. Unlike Collaborative Filtering, which relies on user interactions, Content-Based Filtering focuses on the features of items themselves to suggest similar items to users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exploring Various Techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "    TF-IDF Matrix: We begin by constructing a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) matrix from our dataset of news articles. This matrix represents the importance of each term in each document, allowing us to measure the relevance of articles based on their textual content.\n",
        "\n",
        "    SVD (Singular Value Decomposition): Utilizing SVD, a matrix factorization technique, we decompose the TF-IDF matrix into lower-dimensional matrices. This helps us identify latent factors that capture semantic relationships between articles, enhancing the accuracy of our recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "    LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation): Implementing LDA, a probabilistic model, we uncover latent topics within the articles. By modeling the distribution of topics across articles and words within topics, LDA enables us to recommend articles based on thematic similarities, thereby improving content-based recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "    GloVe Vectorizer: Leveraging GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), a pretrained word embedding model, we transform text into dense vector representations. GloVe embeddings capture semantic relationships between words based on co-occurrence statistics, enabling us to measure similarities between articles more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enhancing Recommendation Quality:\n",
        "Each of these techniques offers unique advantages in capturing semantic relationships and thematic similarities within our news articles dataset. By combining these methods or selecting the most suitable approach based on our evaluation, we aim to enhance the relevance and personalization of our content-based recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, let's explore the implementation details and evaluation of these Content-Based Filtering techniques to understand their impact on our news recommender system."

        "In this section, we explore Collaborative Filtering, a powerful technique in recommendation systems. Unlike Content-Based Filtering, which relies on the characteristics of items and users' past interactions with them, Collaborative Filtering focuses on the collective behavior of users. By analyzing user-item interactions across a dataset, Collaborative Filtering identifies patterns and similarities among users to make personalized recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Matrix Factorization Approach**:\n",
        "For our implementation, we utilized matrix factorization, a common method within Collaborative Filtering. Matrix factorization decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices, capturing latent factors that represent user preferences and item characteristics. This approach helps us predict how users would rate or interact with items they haven't seen based on similar users' behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Synthesis**:\n",
        "To simulate real-world user interactions and evaluate our recommender system, we synthesized our dataset. We created a user-item interaction matrix based on user preferences for randomly selected topics. Articles were served to users with simulated click probabilities and varying time spent, mimicking actual user engagement patterns. This synthesized data allowed us to test and validate our Collaborative Filtering approach effectively.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      A new Gallup poll finds that the percentage of Americans who are social distancing is declining. Fewer Americans said they have avoided events with large crowds (62%), traveling (57%), public places (48%) and small gatherings (45%) in the seven days before being asked by Gallup than at any point since the middle of March 2020, when the pandemic first became a reality for many Americans. This poll is backed up by a late March Axios/Ipsos poll, which showed more and more Americans are willing to take part in activities outside of the house. It's also backed up by travel data such as that from the TSA about how many Americans are flying every day. What's the point: The polling and real world data clearly shows that Americans are starting to come out of their pandemic shells, as state governments loosen restrictions. While plenty of Americans are doing so as they become vaccinated against Covid-19, many are doing so regardless of vaccination. This drop in social distancing is occurring as new cases of Covid-19 are beginning to rise. Indeed, the way some Americans are behaving and the ongoing transmission of the virus reflect a world in which Americans are clearly tired of thinking about a pandemic that is unfortunately very much still with us. Scarily, the people who are putting themselves at the most risk through a lack of social distancing are the people who are the least likely to get vaccinated. For example, just 22% of those who say they'll never get vaccinated say they have avoided public places in the last week compared to 54% of those who are fully vaccinated, according to Gallup polling. There is a partisan angle to this risky behavior too. Republicans were nearly twice as likely (60%) in a late March Ipsos poll to say they have eaten out in the previous week than Democrats (33%). Republicans (62%) were also more likely to say they have visited friends or relatives in the past week than Democrats (38%). This comes even as more Democrats (40%) said they have been vaccinated compared to 27% of Republicans in Gallup's last poll. The issue with fewer Americans social distancing is that the pandemic isn't over. While case counts were falling for the past few months in the US, the decline has clearly stopped. New case counts are rising now and stand at well north of 50,000 in the seven day average. Hospitalization rates, which had been declining and tend to be a lagging indicator of cases, are now pretty much flat at around 40,000. Some parts of the country have it worse. In Michigan, for example, cases and hospitalizations have been up over 100% from where they were the past few weeks. New York's case rate is rising rapidly as well. In some ways, though, it shouldn't be surprising that Americans are taking their foot off the pedal when it comes to social distancing. Many have been social distancing for a year, and their news habits clearly indicate a shift in interest from thinking about the pandemic. For example, fewer people are searching about the coronavirus on Google since March 2020. At the same time, just 31% of Americans told the Pew Research Center in March of this year that they are following news about the coronavirus very closely. That's the lowest of the entire pandemic and is seen across party lines. The shift in news interests was reflected well during President Joe Biden's news conference in March. Although Biden addressed the coronavirus in his opening remarks, not a single question was asked to him on the topic specifically. Some Americans do seem to recognize the pandemic isn't over. The issue of the coronavirus is still ranked as the top problem by 25% of the public in Gallup polling. The Gallup poll roughly matches the last Ipsos poll in which 22% of Americans said they were extremely concerned about the pandemic. Matching their social distancing behaviors, Democrats (35%) were far more likely to say they were extremely concerned than Republicans (10%). Still, even among Democrats, the percentage who are extremely concerned is down more than 10 points in the last two months. Hopefully, even as Americans' concerns about the virus are dropping, enough Americans stay vigilant and get vaccinated soon so that before long, the virus won't be a major problem.   \n",

                                                                                                    Virginia and New Jersey this week joined other Democratic-led states moving ahead with new laws that would expand voting access -- a stark contrast to the Republican rush in statehouses across the country to make voting more difficult. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, which has tracked voting measures across the country, 843 bills that would expand voting access, largely offered by Democrats, have been introduced in 47 states. Republican lawmakers have introduced 361 restrictive bills in a different set of 47 states. Texas, Arizona and Georgia -- states that are competitive in presidential elections, but where Republicans have full control of statehouses -- have seen the largest numbers of restrictive bills introduced, according to the Brennan Center. The crush of new voting rules comes after former President Donald Trump's lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election ignited a new, fiercely partisan flame under the fundamental issue of voting access. There are rare exceptions: Kentucky's Republican-controlled legislature this week passed bipartisan voting reform legislation, sending to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's desk a bill allowing no-excuse in-person early voting on Thursday through Saturday in the week before an election, but backing away from the emergency expansion of mail-in voting that took place last year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Largely, though, states that have expanded voting access are controlled by Democrats. And those that are making voting harder -- Georgia and Iowa already have new laws on the books; Arizona, Florida, Texas, Michigan and other key states are currently advancing bills that would impose new restrictions -- are led by Republicans or, in Michigan's case, have a GOP-controlled legislature that plans to circumvent the Democratic governor. A number of those GOP measures would even prohibit Democratic-led counties, such as Harris County, the largest in Texas and home of Houston, from implementing their own efforts to ease voting access. \"Your access to the ballot depends a lot on where you live,\" said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under Law, \"and the divide is growing.\" It's part of the reason voting rights activists and Democrats have pushed to establish baseline voting rules for all Americans. But those proposals, including the House-passed \"For the People Act,\" which would expand early voting, allow same-day registration, require automatic voter registration, ease ID requirements and more, has not attracted enough Republican support to clear the Senate. Rising partisanship The rush to change voting laws and the heightened attention both parties' bases are paying to the issue shows the hyper-partisan nature of what could be the most significant battle over voting access since the civil rights era. It's a departure from a more recent period in which some overhauls of voting laws were implemented with bipartisan support. Early shifts to mail-only voting, for example, occurred in Republican-dominated Utah and in Oregon, where the change was backed by GOP lawmakers. Previous expansions of voting access often happened \"in what we would deem non-competitive states,\" including traditionally red states such as Alaska, which has automatic voter registration, Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections at Common Cause, said in an online briefing with journalists Wednesday. But following Trump's falsehoods about election fraud, \"what we are now seeing is that any state, that is, you know, Republican-controlled, is trying to move forward on voter-suppression measures, and many Democratic states ... saw the greater outcomes from the last election -- greater turnout and access -- and are moving forward with expansions.\" That's not true in every single state, she said, but \"we are seeing trends, and they are often breaking down\" along partisan lines. What Democratic-led states are doing In Washington, the state legislature has sent to Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee's desk a bill that would automatically restore the voting rights of people convicted of a felony once they are released from prison. The measure was approved despite Republicans' objections to restoring the voting rights of those who are on parole or probation. In Delaware, the state Senate has approved a bill to automatically register voters when they visit the Department of Motor Vehicles. That bill now heads to the House. Virginia -- where Democrats won control of the Senate in late 2019, giving the party its first majority in both chambers of the legislature since 1994 -- has been the most aggressive in expanding voting access. The state in recent months has repealed its voter ID law, made Election Day a holiday, allowed 45 days of no-excuse absentee voting and established automatic voter registration for anyone who obtains a driver's license. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam last month took executive action to immediately restore former felons' voting rights as soon as they complete their prison terms, a move that will immediately apply to more than 69,000 formerly incarcerated Virginians. Northam this week also approved the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, which would make the state the first to enact its own version of the federal Voting Rights Act. He made minor technical changes to the measure, which must be approved by the legislature before it becomes law. The measure would require local elections officials to take public feedback or get advanced approval from the state's attorney general before making changes such as moving voting precincts. It allows the attorney general to sue over voter suppression, and prohibits racial discrimination or intimidation related to voting. \"At a time when voting rights are under attack across our country, Virginia is expanding access to the ballot box, not restricting it,\" Northam said in a statement. Lawmakers in New Jersey have sent the state's Democratic governor two election bills that together would expand voting rights for residents in the state, as GOP-led states move to restrict access to the ballot box elsewhere. The first bill, given final passage from the state Senate on Thursday in a 28-8 vote, would allow residents to vote 10 days before a general election at specially designated polling sites, according to a release from the New Jersey Senate Democrats. The bill only applies to a June primary or a November general election, according to the lawmakers, but municipalities could adopt an early voting period by ordinance for other elections. A spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy said that the governor intends to sign the early voting bill on Tuesday. A second bill sent to the governor gives the county board of elections the ability to determine the location of ballot drop boxes, the lawmakers' release said. The state General Assembly and Senate gave final approval to the measure on Thursday.   \n",

  The Tour Championship, which features the richest prize in golf, will be played in Atlanta as scheduled this September, the PGA Tour said in a statement to CNN. The announcement comes after Major League Baseball said its All-Star Game will be moved from Atlanta in response to new voter laws that critics see as a form of voter suppression. The PGA Tour acknowledged the controversy surrounding Georgia's recently passed laws, saying its intention to hold the Tour Championship in Atlanta \"should not be construed as indifference to the current national conversation around voting rights.\" \"The PGA TOUR fully supports efforts to protect the right of all Americans to vote and to eliminate any barriers that may prevent citizens' voices from being heard and counted,\" according to the statement. \"It is the foundation of our great country and a critical national priority to listen to the concerns about voter suppression — especially from communities of color that have been marginalized in the past — and work together to make voting easier for all citizens.\" Georgia's new election law introduces new impediments to voting, reducing the number of drop boxes in heavily African American areas and allows the state to intervene to assert control over the conduct of elections in Democratic counties. It shortens the time available for absentee votes and introduces new registration requirements that campaigners say are designed to target Black voters. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, says the new law makes it \"easy to vote and hard to cheat in Georgia.\" The Tour Championship has been played at Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club since 1998. The PGA Tour cited its commitment to providing charitable and economic benefits to the community as playing a major factor in its decision. \"In Georgia, this commitment has resulted in more than $38 million generated for local charitable organizations since the TOUR Championship — our season-ending event — moved to Atlanta in 1998,\" the PGA Tour said. \"The TOUR Championship's commitment to East Lake has helped our partners transform distressed neighborhoods into healthy and thriving ones, which is a key to ending the cycle of intergenerational poverty.\" The 2020 Tour Championship featured a $45 million prize pool, with $15 million going to winner Dustin Johnson. This year's event is scheduled for September 2-5. Georgia's most prestigious golf event, the Masters, is scheduled to go ahead in six days at the Augusta National Golf Club amid calls from some to relocate or cancel the tournament. The Masters is run by officials of the private golf club in Augusta. They have not responded to CNN's requests for comment. Johnson also won the 2020 Masters, which was held in November after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              When the coronavirus pandemic began, the challenge for Pfizer and BioNTech wasn't just developing a Covid-19 vaccine -- they also had to make it, and by the hundreds of millions. This was no small feat. Until the very end of last year, no mRNA vaccine had ever been authorized and no such vaccine had ever been manufactured to scale by any company. Pfizer has now shipped more than 100 million doses to the US and it said this week it has successfully met its goal of 120 million doses released and ready for shipment by the end of March. For Mike McDermott, Pfizer's president of global supply, the mission is still more doses. Billions of them. \"Our goal has been running 24/7, make as many doses as possible. I actually don't even have a production goal,\" McDermott told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta during an exclusive tour of its manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in March. \"Our goal is to produce as much as possible to get to 2 billion doses this year as soon as possible.\" Pfizer/BioNTech's global goal is 2.5 billion doses by the end of the year. Big gamble Pfizer met its first milestones with substantial upfront investment, and it had no guarantees. Pfizer was part of Operation Warp Speed as a potential supplier for Covid-19 vaccines and had a purchase agreement for an initial 100 million doses. However, the company didn't receive federal funding for the research or development of the vaccine. So while Pfizer could repurpose some of its equipment at its main manufacturing site in Kalamazoo, most of what's there now didn't exist a year ago. \"Pfizer has spent at risk, almost $2 billion on the overall program. From manufacturing, my team spent $500 million, before we even got out of clinical trials. So all completely at risk. We didn't know if we had a product that was going to work,\" said McDermott. Before Pfizer decided on its final vaccine candidate, it was looking into four different options. That meant McDermott and his team had to be ready to go in any direction. \"I think about like, we're going to have dinner tonight, and we need to get dessert ready, but I don't know what dessert we're having. So you just start buying ingredients,\" he said. \"Maybe we're making a cake, maybe we're making brownies. Let's bring in the standard materials that we need. So filling up this pantry was quite, quite expensive.\" One of the biggest rate-limiting steps of this production, according to McDermott, has been the availability of raw materials and specifically lipids, the fatty substance that safely houses the mRNA until it can get to our cells. \"Lipid nanoparticle hasn't been used in a large commercial product. So the lipid suppliers weren't very large. And so we work very closely with them to build more lipids capacity, and actually making lipids in this site in Kalamazoo, Michigan,\" said McDermott. The heart of mRNA Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine can simply be described as mRNA housed in a lipid coating, but the successful production of that by the millions all came down to a something the size of a quarter. \"The heart of this whole machine is what's called an impingement jet mixer,\" said McDermott as he is twirled it around his fingers. The impingement jet mixer, also known as the tea stirrer, works by simply pumping lipids in one side and mRNA in the other, forcing them together with 400 pounds of pressure. That's what creates the lipid nanoparticle which is essentially the vaccine. These aren't just any lipids, Pfizer/BioNTech had to design the right combination of four different lipids that would not only protect the mRNA on the way to cells, but then release the mRNA once it gets there. While the process of creating lipid nanoparticles is not new, McDermott said the challenge was scaling up this process. \"The first time somebody showed me this impingement jet mixer, I said, 'You can't be serious?' Like how could you put billions of doses through here? So my confidence level was actually quite low. Not that it could be done, I knew it worked at this scale, but how could you multiply it?\" McDermott's first thought was to go bigger, make a large-scale tea stirrer to allow more volume to pass through. When that didn't work, they ended up replicating the quarter-sized mixers and put technology in place to ensure efficiency in order to scale up production. \"There's a computer system that's running the whole apparatus that makes sure you have the precise amount of flow and pressure. And that allowed us to get more production out. Even though this size is small, we were able to really scale this up our original design for this machine. We're currently operating at four times the capacity.\" Make it modular Part of what has allowed Pfizer to continue to make room for these new formulation suites has been its strategy of using prefabricated construction. In its 1,300-acre foot Kalamazoo facility, Pfizer is installing around 13,000 square feet of modular rooms that are first built in Texas and then shipped to Kalamazoo. \"We've had planned to expand our formulation capacity. The question was, how can we do it quickly? If we built it wall by wall on site, it would have taken us a year. By doing it modularly, we could cut that in half,\" says McDermott. Moving each room into place is surprisingly easy. With the help of compressed air -- think of an air hockey table -- you can simply slide them into place. Then the rooms are ready to be connected to electricity, sterilized and put to use. With each of these improvements, Pfizer says it has gone from producing 3 to 4 million doses of vaccine a week to 13 million doses a week. They company expects to double that again by the middle of the year. That will mean roughly 100 million doses a month and the ability to hit its goal of 300 million total doses delivered to the US government by July. What's next McDermott says the last 12 months have been \"like nothing I've ever experienced in my career.\" \"As a kid, my dad worked for NASA,\" McDermott said. \"He was lucky enough to be in mission control in Houston when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon right at that amazing moment. \"I could never imagine having a moment like that in my life. Right? Like, what's the odds that something like that would ever happen again?\" Then came December 13, 2020 -- the day the United States' first coronavirus vaccine, the first step to end the pandemic, left the facility. \"The day we shipped the first doses out of this site, it rushed over me like that was that was my moment,\" McDermott said. \"That was our moonshot.\" But McDermott says vaccine supply is always on his mind, and they have to prepare for the future -- and that means coronavirus variants. Although there is no evidence people immunized with Pfizer's vaccine will be less protected against the current variants, the company has started testing a third dose of its current vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech say they are also in ongoing discussions with regulators about potentially testing a vaccine modified to protect against concerning variants in a Phase 1/2 study. The company's next giant leap is to be ready to get it to patients, if necessary. Pfizer's goal, McDermott says: To be able to develop a new variant-specific vaccine, get it through production and get it to patients within a matter of months.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     When NASA astronaut Leland Melvin was in fifth grade, he found his calling to be a scientist -- by blowing up his living room. He calls it \"the big kaboom.\" Both of Melvin's parents were middle school teachers, and they were constantly encouraging and inspiring him to think outside of the box. His mother gave him a chemistry set that wasn't age-appropriate for a fifth grader and told Melvin to carefully read the instructions. He tossed the instructions aside, mixed the chemicals together and set off an explosion that burned a hole in her carpet, leaving it singed and frayed. She was livid, but the spark had been lit for Melvin. \"I had just liberated fire and brimstone by taking these two clear chemicals and putting them together, and that led me to becoming a chemistry major in college,\" Melvin said. That initial hands-on experience has remained with Melvin throughout his life, and it's something he recognizes as an important way to get kids involved in STEAM, or science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics, early on. It's one of the reasons Melvin teaches classes geared at kids in kindergarten through eighth grade as part of Varsity Tutors' Space Club, which kicked off soon after the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020. Melvin, along with NASA planetary geologist Raquel Nuno, theoretical physicist Brian Greene and space enthusiast Alyssa Carson, teach free, large-group sessions that explore all aspects of space in an after-school virtual program. Smaller sessions, called mission crews, that focus on areas of interest like the solar system, are also available for a fee. At the beginning of the pandemic, the team behind the tutoring company realized they had capabilities for large classes and wanted to offer students a productive way to fill their time at home, said Brian Galvin, chief academic officer at Varsity Tutors. Melvin taught some of the first classes, sharing his experiences as an astronaut and the possibility of humans going to Mars. He wore his flight suit as he talked kids through experiments and answered their questions -- including the ever popular query of how to go to the bathroom in space. The kids in Melvin's classes began to join in by dressing up as astronauts and building \"rocket racers,\" or little rockets made using household products and propelled by air. The classes are designed to be interactive and fun, with a challenge or call to action kids can follow up on, and three or four memorable facts they'll want to share with friends and family, Galvin said. \"Space, dinosaurs and animals are some of the compelling STEM gateways for kids, so we lead with curiosity and open-ended questions to get them thinking,\" Galvin said. Melvin was attracted to the idea of teaching these classes because they could be easily accessed by kids at home with an internet connection and computer or tablet, and students could learn from instructors with diverse voices and backgrounds. \"It's really about three things: access, opportunity and belief in themselves,\" Melvin said. \"We have to make sure kids get it, because every ZIP code does not have access and we have Katherine Johnsons in the wings waiting to do great things, but don't have that access to those opportunities. The opportunities are there, and we just need to keep pumping in that inspiration.\" Alyssa Carson will teach her class about the history of space travel on April 5. The 20-year-old wants to be the first person to go to Mars. She knew at 3 years old she wanted to travel to the red planet. Carson has a multitude of experience under her belt for someone her age, having attended Space Camp seven times among other enriching experiences that have certified her to make her an astronaut trainee and go to space. Her class focuses on both the history and future of human space travel, addressing the kids in her class as the \"Mars Generation,\" since they will witness humans reach Mars the same way people witnessed Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon in 1969. It's an exciting time to think about space, Carson said. The return of humans to the moon in 2024 through NASA's Artemis program, and all of the focus on Mars, means that the kids focused on learning about space now will have \"endless amounts of opportunities\" to pursue their areas of interest in the future, she said. \"This is really just unchartered territory,\" Carson said. \"For the first time ever in space, we're able to do more than one thing at a time in space. We can have astronauts living on the International Space Station, we can have NASA having plans of wanting to go to the moon and Mars. I want to encourage kids to pursue their dreams, discover different passions or maybe even spark a new one.\" Subscribe to CNN's Wonder Theory newsletter: Sign up and explore the universe with weekly news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Inspired by space For Space Club instructor Raquel Nuno, the fascination with space began when she was a little girl growing up in Portugal. Her birthday fell on the day when the Perseids meteor shower typically peaked. Nuno and her family would go to the beach and watch meteors streak across the sky. Nuno was filled with questions about space, so her parents, who painted ceramics, would take her to the planetarium and the library. One of her prized possessions remains a book on amateur astronomy that Nuno's dad bought her when she was young. Nuno and her family moved to the US when she was 11. Although she was interested in pursuing science, Nuno wasn't sure how to go about it. Her dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and Nuno wanted to help provide for him, so she went into the Air Force after high school. After she left the Air Force, Nuno rediscovered the book her father gave her and she was reminded of her childhood dreams. Nuno began attending community college, focusing on science and math, and started an internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. She worked with scientists and engineers who were coming up with mission concepts to answer questions about our solar system, as well as the types of instruments needed on spacecraft to help find those answers. \"It was at JPL that I discovered this field of planetary science,\" Nuno said. \"I didn't even know planetary geology was a thing. And I figured out this is exactly what I want to do: answering science questions.\" Nuno pursued an undergraduate degree in geophysics and space physics, and this year she's finishing up her doctorate at the University of Californa, Los Angeles. She also works on an instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the moon since 2009. Her expertise is in impact craters, so when she teaches classes, she has kids do meteor impact experiments, like dropping different size objects in sand to see the craters they create. Their excitement inspires Nuno to be more curious and to be unafraid to ask questions in her own work. \"They haven't lost their natural curiosity and wonder about the world,\" she said. When Nuno pictured a scientist as she was growing up, she thought of Bill Nye or Albert Einstein. \"But I didn't know what it actually meant to be a scientist,\" Nuno said. \"I really want to show kids that you don't have to look a certain way or act a certain way. If you have curiosity and if you want to do it, you can do it.\" Nuno acknowledges that she wasn't sure she would be good at science, and that fear almost stopped her from pursuing STEM. Her advice to kids is to give it a try, especially if they're passionate about it. \"There's so many questions left to answer and we need all kinds of people to come and help answer at different viewpoints,\" Nuno said. \"That's how we are going to discover the cosmos. Thousands of people make a mission work, and there's a place for everyone.\"   \n",

Covid-19 pandemic first broke, Brian Mask, a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, immediately saw the danger it posed to his tribe. \"I knew it was gonna be bad because we Natives, you look at the history, our immune systems are not built for a lot of stuff,\" said Mask, who lives on the Pearl River Reservation near Philadelphia, Mississippi. The coronavirus spread through his community last spring, along with a wave of confusion and fear. Deaths spiked going into the summer; the tribe lost 33 members in June alone. Mask's friend and fellow tribal member Marsha Berry also lives on the reservation, where many families live in multi-generational homes. She told CNN that early in the pandemic, as residents had to wait about a week for their test results, many unknowingly spread Covid-19 to parents and grandparents before learning they were positive. \"We didn't have any guidance, any type of Instruction on what to do. So, we kind of were left out to fend for ourselves,\" Berry said. Those who tested positive were often unprepared to quarantine for 14 days, without enough food, supplies or a support system at home. Mask's fiancé, Sandy Steve, shared the story of a mother of three in their community who was suffering from Covid-19. Her 7-year-old daughter had to continually wake her up to make sure she was still alive. \"First thing I thought about,\" Mask said, \"was (this is) going to affect that child for the rest of her life.\" The story angered Mask, but also inspired him to take action. He went on Facebook and \"said some things that I shouldn't have said,\" but that's when he also linked up with Berry, Steve, and another acquaintance Rian Willis to help. They decided to collect donated food and hygiene products for what was supposed to be a one-day drive last June, offering families exposed to the coronavirus much-needed supplies. They secured a former Dollar General location to collect the items, and Berry announced the donation drive on a Facebook Live video. The community's response was overwhelming. The group received far more donations than they were able to give away in one afternoon. Unable to fit the excess items in their homes, they turned the former Dollar General store into a temporary headquarters for their effort, which they named \"Honoring the Choctaw Spirit.\" Donations rolled in over the summer as the virus spread to more families. While the local Choctaw Health Center was the first stop for most tribal members, helicopters flew the sicker Covid-19 patients to a hospital in Jackson, Mississippi -- about 80 miles away. Mask said he would hear choppers flying over his house every night. Berry recalled the emotional toll of the constant airlifts. \"I remember sitting here so many times and just ... putting my hands over my ears so that I wouldn't hear the helicopters, because the helicopters came three or four times a day to pick up another tribal member,\" she said. \"The majority of [them] never made it back home.\" Mask has lost family members to the pandemic, including a cousin who was just three months younger than him; they shared a crib and grew up together. \"He was healthy ... and a week later, he's in the hospital with it. It just blows you away ... you talk to somebody one day and the next day they're gone.\" The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians claim about 11,000 members. As of March 18, they had lost 113 members. The tribe's cultural losses are staggering. Mask says they lost the wife of a former chief, storytellers, traditional dancers, and stickball players, which he describes as a game similar to lacrosse. \"We were in a constant state of grief,\" Berry said. \"Having to deal with death on a daily basis, we almost became desensitized. Our funeral rites were taken from us because we couldn't gather. We couldn't mourn.\" The group kept the donation drives going every Saturday through the summer. Eventually, as the numbers of new cases began to decrease, Mask and other tribal members returned to their jobs. Honoring the Choctaw Spirit then moved its effort online, creating a Facebook Group to connect with exposed families and allow them to request specific donations. After his overnight shift as a pit manager at the Pearl River Resort, Mask would return home for a few hours of sleep before driving deliveries to those in need. Nowadays, donation requests spread mostly through word of mouth or Facebook posts, Mask said. He is also running a drive to fill Easter Baskets for tribal children who lost loved ones in the pandemic. Mask acknowledges some tribal members are hesitant about getting the Covid-19 vaccine. He admits that he was scared, but given his work environment, he was glad to get it. Seeing casino patrons refusing to wear a mask frustrates him, he says, and he has a message for them: \"While you may wanna die, I have a responsibility to these people out here.\" Despite all the losses, Mask and Berry say they see a silver lining in this tragedy: their drives unified tribal members to help each other while reacquainting old friends and building relationships. Mask, who still makes deliveries to those affected by Covid-19, also gained a sense of personal satisfaction from this work. \"I didn't grow up the perfect person in the world or anything, but I went to sleep every night with a smile on my face knowing I'm going to heaven. That sounds stupid, but it's my mindset now.\"   \n",

                                                                                              The Biden administration on Thursday unveiled a large-scale effort to encourage Americans to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, rolling out its first national ad campaign and announcing a national network of community organizations, sports leagues and other leaders to boost confidence in the vaccines. The Department of Health and Human Services is spending $10 million to air four new TV ads this month, two administration officials told CNN, framing vaccination as a way for Americans to fight back against the pandemic and reclaim their lives with the slogan \"We can do this.\" One of the ads is in Spanish and another, narrated by Henry Louis Gates Jr., the prominent intellectual, author and filmmaker, is aimed at Black Americans. The rollout comes as the Biden administration prepares for the next phase of the US's vaccination effort, with vaccines becoming more accessible and more widely available. All adults are expected to be eligible to get their shot by May 1, putting concerns about vaccine hesitancy front of mind. Beyond TV ads, the administration's vaccine confidence campaign centers around efforts to equip trusted voices with the information and resources to tout the safety and efficacy of the coronavirus vaccine. The administration honed in on those efforts after research showed that Americans were most likely to rely on doctors and community leaders as they decide whether to get vaccinated. Nearly 300 organizations -- including doctors' groups, sports leagues, rural organizations, unions and religious groups -- have signed up to be part of that effort, which the administration is calling the COVID-19 Community Corps. The administration plans to provide those groups with weekly updates about the science behind the vaccines as well as talking points, factsheets and other resources to help people schedule their vaccine appointments. HHS and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are also launching new profile picture frames on Facebook to help Americans who have or plan to get vaccinated to encourage their friends and families. Facebook will promote the frames and encourage influencers to use them, HHS said in a statement. The Community Corps includes a slew of groups who could appeal to conservatives -- including NASCAR, evangelical Christian groups and veterans' organizations -- a demographic the administration is honing in on after several polls showed there are least likely to plan to get vaccinated. About 47% of people who supported Trump in the 2020 election said they would not get a coronavirus vaccine if it became available to them, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. The Community Corps also includes groups representing Black and Hispanic communities, groups that are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus due to high rates of preexisting conditions and high-risk, essential work. The ads released Thursday by the administration will air on Black and Spanish-language media platforms, in addition to airing on cable and broadcast networks. The Biden administration also announced plans last week to spend nearly $10 billion to expand access to coronavirus vaccines for hardest-hit and highest-risk communities, including $3 billion to strengthen confidence in the vaccine in those communities. Vice President Kamala Harris and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy are meeting Thursday morning with founding members of the Community Corps. Thursday's rollout is just one step in the administration's efforts to promote and increase confidence in the coronavirus vaccines. Congress allocated $1 billion toward that effort through the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that Biden signed into law last month.   \n",

                                                                                             Attorney Ben Crump spoke to CBS News about two families he is representing: the families of George Floyd and Daunte Wright.  Floyd was killed in May 2020 after Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, placed his knee on Floyd's neck while he pleaded, \"I can't breathe.\" Chauvin — who is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — is currently on trial. The 13th day of testimony will begin this morning. Wright was killed Sunday during a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota — which is about 10 miles away from where Chauvin's trial is playing out. “George Floyd’s family, about this time last year, was dealing with this unthinkable intrusion into their lives and now they’re having to tell Daunte Wright’s mother, father, his baby’s mother, what they’re going to have to endure,” Crump said. “The assault on his character, trying to assassinate his character after they assassinated his person, about how they’re going to have grieve in the public’s eye.” Crump said said he and Wright’s family don’t think the resignation of officer Kim Potter — who authorities say shot and killed Wright after a traffic stop Sunday — is “fair that she can kill him and say ‘I made a mistake' and then resign and keep all her benefits and pensions.” Wright's death Sunday during a traffic stop — which the former Brooklyn Center police chief said appeared to be the result of the officer mistaking her gun for her Taser — has sparked widespread anger. Potter resigned from the force yesterday. Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott told CNN Tuesday that Kim Potter — who authorities say shot and killed Daunte Wright during a routine traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota — submitted a letter of resignation from the Brooklyn Center Police Department. In a letter, Potter wrote that she \"loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability.\" Elliott said Potter decided on her own to resign from the police department. \"We did not ask her to resign. That was a decision she made,\" he said. At a news conference by Elliott Tuesday, people in the room voiced concerns that Potter resigned and was not fired. The mayor said he has \"not accepted her resignation\" and that his office is continuing to review the matter. \"We're doing our internal process to make sure that we are being accountable to the steps that we need to take,\" Elliott told reporters. Hundreds gathered for a third night of protests to express anger over the police killing of a Black man in a Minneapolis suburb as prosecutors could decide as soon as Wednesday whether to charge the officer authorities say shot him. The Washington County prosecutor is weighing charges for former Brooklyn Center police Officer Kim Potter in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Daunte Wright, he told CNN. \"I hope to have a charging decision by tomorrow,\" prosecutor Pete Orput said in an email Tuesday afternoon. \"I just received voluminous documents, and with enough coffee, I'll have something tomorrow.\" Wright's death Sunday during a traffic stop, which then-Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon said appeared to be the result of Potter mistaking her gun for her Taser, has sparked widespread anger.   \n",
              "1683  Hennepin County's chief medical examiner and a forensic pathologist testified today in the trial of former officer Derek Chauvin. They detailed what they found during the course of examining George Floyd's death. Here's what they said today in court: Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County chief medical examiner who performed Floyd's autopsy, said he still classifies Floyd's death as a homicide, and that his opinion remains unchanged. He told the court that Floyd's heart disease and use of fentanyl were contributing factors to his death, but they were not the direct cause. Asked about the autopsy and Floyd's death certificate, Baker described the \"top line of the cause of death\" as \"what you think is the most important thing that precipitated the death.\" \"Other things that you think played a role in the death but were not direct causes get relegated to what's known as the 'other significant conditions' part of the death certificate,\" he said. \"For example, you know, Mr. Floyd's use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint. His heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint.\" Chauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, has argued that Floyd died as a result of drugs and preexisting health conditions. And under cross examination, Baker said he believed those factors played a role. But Baker reiterated he stood by the cause of death he wrote on Floyd's death certificate and his finding that Floyd's death was a homicide, which to a medical examiner means his death was caused by another person and does not necessarily indicate guilt. Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas, who has worked as a medical examiner herself, including in the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office, and who was part of Baker's training, agreed with Baker's finding in the cause of death, adding she believed the \"primary mechanism of death is asphyxia or low oxygen.\" Because of the restraint and his position, she said, Floyd was \"unable to get enough oxygen in\" to support his body's functions. Thomas explained the technical wording of the medical examiner's finding in the cause of death, saying, \"What it means to me is that the activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr. Floyd's death. And that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint and the neck compression.\" \"There's no evidence,\" she later added, \"to suggest he would have died that night except for the interactions with law enforcement.\" Court is adjourned until Monday morning when testimony is expected to resume in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin. The medical examiner who ruled George Floyd’s death a homicide last year says due to the 46-year-old's underlying health conditions, his body was simply not able to survive being subdued by police.   “He has a heart that already needs more oxygen than a normal heart by virtue of its size and its limited in its ability to step up to provide more oxygen when there's demand because of the narrowing of his coronary arteries,” Dr. Andrew Baker, Hennepin County's chief medical examiner, told prosecutor Jerry Blackwell. “The law enforcement subdue will restrain to the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of that those heart conditions.” Baker explained to the jury in the trial of Derek Chauvin how he examined Floyd’s body to identify any injuries and found cuts and bruises on Floyd’s face and hands from the interaction with police.   “These are blunt force injuries, these are abrasions and lacerations, again, that's damage to the skin from blunt trauma. These would be entirely consistent with him, having been in an altercation with another person,” Baker testified.   He looked under the skin on Floyd’s back to see if there were any signs of bruising and found none. “Sometimes, fresh bruises can be difficult to see in some people, so we look underneath the skin to make sure we have a missed something,” he testified.   Baker did not photograph Floyd’s heart since it appeared normal, though the weight was slightly larger due to high blood pressure, he said.   “The weight of the heart is a very good predictor as to whether that heart is normal or not, people who have high blood pressure for a long period of time, their heart will actually get heavier, just like any muscle that’s worked hard. The heart will grow in response to that kind of stress,” Baker testified.   Floyd’s arteries were dissected looking for narrowing or blockages and significant hardening was found. “You should be seeing through a round hole in each of those but they're pretty severely narrowed,” Baker told the jury as they looked at photos of the dissected blood vessels. He said there was no sign of clots in his coronary artery and no damage to the heart muscle itself.   Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County chief medical examiner who performed George Floyd's autopsy, said he still classifies Floyd's death as a homicide which, in the medical world, is not an assignment of guilt or malicious intent necessarily. \"My opinion remains unchanged. It's what I put on the death certificate last June. That's cardiopulmonary arrest, complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression. That was my top line then and it would stay my top line now,\" Baker said during the trial of former officer Derek Chauvin today. In regards to any underlying medical conditions Floyd may have suffered from or what may have been in his system in May 2020, Baker said \"they are not direct causes of Mr. Floyd's death.\" \"They're contributing causes,\" he added. \"I would still classify it as a homicide today.\" The underlying heart disease George Floyd suffered from \"contributed\" but was not \"the direct cause\" of his death, Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner who performed Floyd's autopsy, testified in court today. \"I don't know that we specifically got to it, counselor, but Mr. Floyd also had what we call hypertensive heart disease, meaning his heart weighed more than it should,\" Baker said to prosecuting attorney Jerry Blackwell. \"He has a heart that already needs more oxygen than a normal heart by virtue of its size, and it's limited in its ability to step up to provide more oxygen when there's demand because of the narrowing of his coronary arteries.\" Baker went on to explain what Floyd's heart was likely put through in May 2020 during the incident with police. \"Now, in the context of an altercation with other people that involves things like physical restraint, that involves things like being held to the ground, that involves things like the pain you would incur from having your cheek up against the asphalt and abrasion on your shoulder, those events are going to cause stress hormones to pour out into your body like adrenaline,\" Baker added. \"The adrenaline will ask your heart to beat faster, it will ask your body for more oxygen so that you can get through that altercation. And, in my opinion, the law enforcement subdual restraint and neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions.\" Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner who performed George Floyd's autopsy, told the court he has \"no reason to believe\" Floyd's tumor – a paraganglioma – discovered in his pelvis had anything to do with his  death.  \"Short answer is, I don't feel Mr. Floyd's paraganglioma had anything to do with his death,\" Baker said.  \"What we're talking about is an incidental tumor I happened to find in his pelvis during the autopsy. I did look at it under the microscope. The likely diagnosis is a paraganglioma but I have no reason to believe that had anything to do with Mr. Floyd's death,\" he continued. Moments before, Baker made similar comments about Floyd's sickle cell trait. \"Sickle cell trait is carried by about 8% of Americans of African heritage. What it means is that one of the genes that codes for the beta chain of hemoglobin has an abnormal substitution in it. If you just have sickle cell trait, chances are you will go through life and never have any symptoms from it because you make plenty of normal hemoglobin,\" Baker told the court. \"So, it's really just a fluke that it got picked up at autopsy. In my opinion, it doesn't have anything to do with why he died,\" he added. Baker ruled Floyd's death last May was a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County chief medical examiner, testified today that George Floyd's autopsy revealed that he did not have have any prior heart damage before the incident in May 2020. \"Mr. Floyd had no visible or microscopic previous damage to his heart muscle,\" Baker said. Earlier today: Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, said the \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of law enforcement of Floyd was \"ultimately\" the immediate cause of death. \"This is a death where both the heart and lung stopped working. And the point is that it's due to law enforcement subdual, restraint and compression. That is kind of what ultimately is the immediate cause of death. It's the subdual, restraint and compression,\" Thomas said.  Asked by the prosecution to explain what the terms \"subdual restraint and neck compression\" mean, Thomas said: \"Those were activities by the law enforcement agency officers involved. Subdual is subduing someone, trying to restrain them. In Mr. Floyd's case, involved handcuffing him, his positioning on the ground, the prone position. The people kneeling on him. And the net compression is the knee on the neck specifically. Additionally, there was some back and other things being compressed by the officers.\"  Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner, testified today that George Floyd's autopsy revealed that he had suffered \"several injuries to his face\" in May 2020. \"And these were specifically taken to illustrate the injuries you see on the corner of his left eyebrow and on his left cheek,\" Baker said in response to being shown autopsy photos today in court of Floyd's body. \"You can see the bruising and the abrasion. That's fancy medical lingo for the big scrape on the left side of his forehead. You can see the scrape or the abrasion on the left side of his cheek. It's a very common for abrasions post-mortem to take on the dark black color. After death, the moisture in the abrasion on you or me isn't there any more and they tend to dry out and look more like what you see in the photo.\" Baker added: \"These would be entirely consistent with the left side of his face being pinned against the asphalt or road surface he was on the night before.\" Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker, who performed George Floyd's autopsy, told the prosecuting attorney that he did not view videos of Floyd's death before examining the body. \"I was aware at least one video had gone viral on the internet. But I intentionally chose not to look at that until I had examined Mr. Floyd. I did not want to bias my exam by going in with preconceived notions that might lead me down one pathway or another,\" Baker said. Baker ruled Floyd's death last May was a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" The medical examiner saw the videos upon completing the autopsy. \"One video I saw shortly after the autopsy, that was the one most of the public had seen through Facebook or other social media, the other videos such as the cub surveillance video and the body worn camera videos, I did not see until three or four days after the autopsy,\" Baker said. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker, who performed George Floyd's autopsy, has taken the stand. Baker ruled Floyd's death last May a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's official autopsy made no mention of asphyxiation as a cause of death, which has been a key pillar of prosecutors' case. The court has returned from a lunch break, and testimony has resumed in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin. Earlier today, forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas testified that the \"primary mechanism\" of George Floyd's death was \"asphyxia or low oxygen.\" She told the court she ruled out drugs as a factor in Floyd's death. Shareeduh Tate, George Floyd’s cousin, said that she thinks the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin is “going in the right direction.” “The testimony from the experts really drove home what we thought all along, is that, you know, his cause of death was from the neck compression and not from a drug overdose,” Tate said.  The family is “dealing with it as best that we can” as they re-live Floyd’s death through the trial, she added. Tate has said she's “pessimistically optimistic” about the trial, and she thinks many Black Americans who are watching the trial feel the same way.   “We know that it's not a foregone conclusion that we'll end up with a conviction,” she said. The first day of the trial stood out for her, she said, since that was the first time she saw the video of her cousin outside of Cup Foods.  Charles McMillan’s testimony also struck a chord with her, she said. McMillian, who was one of the first bystanders on the scene as Floyd was being taken into custody in May 2020, broke down on the stand during his testimony after watching footage of his arrest. “There’s been a lot of prayers and support for our family. But I would ask that there be for the same for these bystanders and these people who are testifying, but who are essentially having to relive the fact that they, you know, they watched this murder in real-time. So I really liked the way that he seemed to ... really connect with what was going on,” Tate said.   Hypothetical scenarios introduced in the murder trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin are “dangerous,” according to CNN legal analyst Laura Coates.  “Both prosecutors, but especially defense, have got to be very wary about using hypotheticals. Because it comes across to the jury that they're trying to be cute or they're being disingenuous or they just don't get what we're talking about,” Coates said.  While cross-examining forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas, defense attorney Eric Nelson asked her about George Floyd's heart disease and what the cause of death would be if police were taken out of the incident altogether. Earlier, Thomas testified that the \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of Floyd by law enforcement was \"ultimately\" the immediate cause of his death. “You're trying to distill this down in such a reductive way that you're losing all of the facts that are at issue in this case. So every time this defense counsel tries to raise hypotheticals that have nothing to do with the facts, he invites a new witness — not a fact witness, but an expert witness — to now revisit and remind the jury of what happened to George Floyd in his final moments,” Coates said.  For the first time during the trial, the seat reserved for a representative for Derek Chauvin's family was filled today by a woman, according to reports from two courtroom pool reporters. Deputies had previously removed the seat from the courtroom as no representative of the Chauvin family had attended the trial until this point. Pool reports note a deputy is sitting between the George Floyd and Chauvin family representatives. The two are not seen looking at each other.  The court has taken a break for lunch. Testimony is expected to resume after the break. Jurors in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin seem “relatively well-engaged” and “appear to be listening” to Friday morning's testimony from forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas, according to reports from two courtroom pool reporters. When Thomas told the court she believed “asphyxia or low oxygen” was the “primary mechanism” of George Floyd’s death, “nearly all jurors were seen writing this down.” A packet of photos from Floyd’s autopsy was passed out to jurors, pool reporters and spectators in court during Thomas' testimony Friday morning. The packets included “close up photos of his face, shoulders and hands. His body is brightly lit – almost portrait style. There is nothing outwardly clinical about the photos.” One pool reporter observed all jurors looking through the photos and “some are seen flipping ahead looking at all the images.” The Floyd family representative “didn’t have any obvious emotional reaction” to the packet of autopsy photos, but one pool reporter noted “he spent a long time staring at the first image, before thumbing through the remaining images.” One pool report included the following descriptions of the autopsy photos presented to jurors: “Exhibit 185 is a close-up photo of Floyd, a white tube appearing protrude from his mouth from emergency respiratory efforts. His face is scraped over left eyebrow and on left cheek. All the jurors are looking through the photos at this point, some are seen flipping ahead looking at all the images.” “Exhibit 235 is a close up of the abrasions on the left side of Floyd’s face taken from the side.” “Exhibit 188 is a photo of Floyd’s left shoulder with a large abrasion which Thomas tells the jury is evidence of Floyd trying to push himself up.” “Exhibit 187 is a photo of Floyd’s right shoulder, which shows some scrapes but not as large as the abrasion on Floyd’s left shoulder.” “Exhibit 189 is a photo of Floyd’s left hand, which is ringed by a large red mark. Thomas testifies this is from the handcuff. Jurors are looking at the photos as she speaks.” “Exhibit 190 is a photo of Floyd’s right hand, which shows a similar mark from a handcuff. Thomas points out scrapes on his knuckles and fingers which she tells the jury came from when he was reaching out towards the squad car tire and “push his body into a position again where he can breathe.”  Both pool reporters noted that for the first time during the trial, the seat reserved for a Derek Chauvin family representative is filled today by a woman. Deputies had previously removed the seat from the courtroom as no representative of the Chauvin family had attended the trial until this point. Pool reporters have not yet been able to identify the Floyd family representative in court Friday. The reports note a deputy is sitting between the Floyd and Chauvin family representatives. The two are not seen looking at each other.  A member of the jury in the Derek Chauvin trial was questioned Friday morning by Judge Peter Cahill about “some concerns expressed” over outside influences, according to reports from two courtroom pool reporters.   The questioning of juror took place on the record before testimony in the trial began Friday, but broadcast of video and audio was not allowed by the judge.  The woman juror told Cahill “she had turned on a television and briefly saw coverage” and “saw an image of the courtroom with a woman with dark hair.” The woman explained to the judge that her volume was off and she quickly turned off the TV, according to the report.  When Cahill asked the woman if she had any contact with her family about the case, the woman replied her mother-in-law had texted her and said, “Looks like it was a bad day,” according to one report. The second pool report differed and said the text was from the woman’s mother. The woman told the judge she did not respond to the text.  “Any book deal in the works?” Cahill asked.  “The woman became slightly flustered or surprised,” according to one report. “No, I don’t know how this case is going to go,” the woman responded. She reiterated she hasn’t talked to anyone about the trial.  According to the reports, after the woman left the courtroom, Cahill asked if attorneys wanted to make any motions. Defense attorney Eric Nelson declined. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher said he would like the record to note the woman’s demeanor. Cahill noted the woman seemed “surprised.”   Defense attorney Eric Nelson is now questioning forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas. Thomas testified earlier today that the \"primary mechanism\" of George Floyd's death was \"asphyxia or low oxygen.\" She told the court she ruled out drugs as a factor in Floyd's death. Thomas explained that Floyd's death was not \"sudden\" like you would get with methamphetamine. And it was not slow like you would see with fentanyl, where \"the death is slow, it's peaceful, they fall asleep,\" she said. The trial has resumed after a 20-minute break. Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas continues her testimony on the stand. The court is taking a 20-minute break. Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist will continue her testimony when court resumes. Before the recess, Dr. Thomas was being asked about George Floyd's manner of death and why she agrees with Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker's ruling that Floyd's death last May was a homicide. Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas said a “secondary mechanism\" in George Floyd's death is what she referred to as \"physiologic stress.” \"It's that kind of fear of life that I'm talking about for physiologic stress,\" she said, using an example of the feeling a person would experience when they narrowly avoid getting into a car crash or when they momentarily lose sight of their child on a crowded beach. She detailed what goes on in the body when this feeling arises, including more adrenaline, increased blood pressure, release of stress hormones and a racing heart. \"You start needing more oxygen in your muscles. You need to take more breaths. You need more oxygen for your heart rate because your heart is beating faster,\" she said. \"All of those physical things, those chemical things, can cause reactions in the body that put additional stress primarily on your heart but also on all of your body systems,\" Thomas added. The physiologic stress was a \"double whammy\" to Floyd's system, Thomas said: \"Mr. Floyd was already in a position where he was experiencing difficulty breathing and getting enough oxygen in his body. And on top of that, now, there's this physiologic stress that is putting increased demand on his heart, increased demand on his lungs, increased demand on his muscles. So all of the things that he's using — his muscles, his strength, his body — to try and get himself into a safe position where he can breathe, those are being doubly stressed by the position that he's in, as well as the underlying chemical reactions that are going on in his body. So it's kind of a double whammy to his heart and lungs and muscles and his whole system,\" she said. In Floyd's case, she said, the \"primary mechanism [of death] I think is asphyxia, or low oxygen, and the secondary mechanism is this physiologic stress, but ultimately the cause of death is the subdual, restraint and compression.\" Physiologic stress cannot be observed on an autopsy, since it is a chemical reaction, Thomas explained. The jury was presented a set of photos by the prosecution that showed George Floyd's injuries. The images, the prosecuting attorney said, depict the points made by forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas about the \"superficial injuries\" that she believes support the conclusion of Floyd's cause of death. Earlier in her testimony, she said \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of law enforcement on Floyd was \"ultimately\" the immediate cause of death. The judge said the images of Floyd would not be shown in the monitors, but everyone in the court room will have access to them. This is what Thomas said about the injuries Floyd sustained during his arrest: \"So Mr. Floyd, had superficial injuries, what would be described as superficial injuries specifically on his face, shoulders, wrists. And what that does, is it supports what I saw in the videos, which is that he is being forcibly restrained and subdued and he's trying to move into a position by rubbing his face against the concrete cement of the ground, by pulling against his handcuffs. You can see the injury to his wrists from the handcuffs. And by pushing with his shoulder. And he also had some scrapes on his knuckles on his right hand. Again that, that was from him pushing to try to get into a position where he could breathe.\" Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas clearly told the court that she ruled out drugs as a factor in George Floyd's death. She explained that Floyd's death was not \"sudden\" like you would get with methamphetamine. And it was not slow like you would see with fentanyl, where \"the death is slow, it's peaceful, they fall asleep,\" she said. The prosecutor asked, \"Then based on your review of the video and application of the experience and knowledge, did you rule out drug overdose as a cause of death?\"  \"Yes,\" Thomas said.  The prosecutor continued: \"And that's an opinion you hear to a degree of medical certainty?\"  \"Yes,\" she said.  Earlier in her testimony Thomas told the court that it was the \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of law enforcement on Floyd that was \"ultimately\" the cause of his death. Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, said the \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of law enforcement of George Floyd was \"ultimately\" the immediate cause of death. \"This is a death were both the heart and lung stopped working. And the point is that it's due to law enforcement subdual, restraint and compression. That is kind of what ultimately is the immediate cause of death. It's the subdual, restraint and compression,\" Thomas said.  Asked by the prosecution to explain what the terms \"subdual restraint and neck compression\" mean, Thomas said: \"Those were activities by the law enforcement agency officers involved. Subdual is subduing someone, trying to restrain them. In Mr. Floyd's case, involved handcuffing him, his positioning on the ground, the prone position. The people kneeling on him. And the net compression is the knee on the neck specifically. Additionally, there was some back and other things being compressed by the officers.\"  If you put all of those together, she continued, \"what it means to me, is that the activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr. Floyd's death. And that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint and the neck compression.\"  Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, said the \"primary mechanism\" of George Floyd's death was \"asphyxia or low oxygen.\"  Thomas said she agrees with the determination from Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker — who performed Floyd's autopsy — on the cause of death, which was \"cardiopulmonary complicating law enforcement subdual restraint and neck compression.\" \"This is not a sudden cardiac death, a sudden cardiac arrhythmia. This is a death where both the heart and lungs stopped working. And the point is that it's due to law enforcement subdual, restraint and compression. That is kind of what ultimately is the immediate cause of death,\" she said. Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, is now testifying. Asked by the prosecuting attorney to describe her field of expertise, she said: \"Forensic pathologists, is a branch of pathology, branch of medicine, where medicine and law overlap. So, it could be anything with a medical and legal component, could be toxicology, in some cases, it may involve living patients. But as I practice, and as most forensic pathologists practice, involves what's called, medical legal, death investigation.\"  \"We don't directly treat patients. But we provide information to doctors who then do treat patients,\" she added later on in questioning. Thomas noted that she is not being paid for her time and service in this case. \"I knew this was going to be important. And I felt like I had something to offer. I wanted to do what I could to help explain what I think happened,\" she said. She said she was asked to review \"a lot of material and come to an independent conclusion about what I thought the cause and manner of death were and the mechanism for that cause.\" Day 10 of testimony in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged in the death of George Floyd, just began. A forensic pathologist has taken the stand. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker, who performed the autopsy of George Floyd, is also expected to testify today. Baker ruled that Floyd's death last May was a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" Jurors heard testimony yesterday from three expert witnesses for the prosecution, including a pulmonologist who said Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen.\" Crucial testimony in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin is expected today when the medical examiner who performed George Floyd's autopsy takes the stand. Prosecutors intend to call Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker. He ruled Floyd's death last May a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's official autopsy made no mention of asphyxiation as a cause of death, which has been a key pillar of prosecutors' case. Baker's testimony will come on the 10th day of Chauvin's trial, the culmination of a week filled with expert testimony by not only medical experts, but also policing experts who testified Chauvin violated policy and used excessive force on Floyd. A pulmonary critical care doctor testified Thursday that Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen\" when Chauvin pinned him to the street with his knee, restricting Floyd's ability to breathe. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, third-degree murder and third-degree manslaughter charges. Why these testimonies matter: The medical analysis is important to the prosecution's case that Chauvin was a substantial cause of Floyd's death when he put his body weight on Floyd's neck and back for over nine minutes – causing death by \"positional asphyxia.\" Chauvin's defense attorney Eric Nelson has argued that Floyd died of a drug overdose and preexisting health conditions. We expect another big day of testimony today, with the medical examiner who performed George Floyd's autopsy taking the stand. A renowned pulmonary critical care doctor testified Thursday morning that George Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen\" when former police officer Derek Chauvin pinned him to the street and restricted his ability to breathe. \"This caused damage to his brain that we see, and it also caused a PEA arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop,\" Dr. Martin Tobin of Chicago testified, referring to pulseless electrical activity, a type of cardiac arrest. \"The cause of the low level of oxygen was shallow breathing,\" he added. \"Small breaths. Small tidal volumes. Shallow breaths that weren't able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas of the lungs that get oxygen into the blood and get rid of the carbon dioxide.\" He identified four main reasons why Floyd died: The handcuffs and the street acting as a \"vise\" Chauvin's left knee on his neck Floyd's prone position Chauvin's right knee on Floyd's back, arm and side Combined, these limited Floyd's ability to expand his lungs and narrowed his hypopharynx, a part of the throat that air passes through. Floyd's preexisting health conditions and drug use were not relevant to his death, Tobin said. \"A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died,\" he said. Tobin's testimony came on the ninth day of the trial as prosecutors shifted into the third phase of their case, focusing on the medical analysis of Floyd's cause of death.  Read more about how the trial unfolded yesterday here. The trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin will enter day 10 of testimony today. We're expecting the prosecution to call more witnesses. Here's a recap of what's happened so far this week: Monday: Three witnesses took the stand. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck was not a trained tactic and was a violation of the policies around de-escalation, objectively reasonable use of force and requirement to render aid. Dr. Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld treated Floyd and said the \"more likely possibility\" of Floyd's cardiac arrest was hypoxia, or lack of oxygen. Minneapolis Police Inspector Katie Blackwell, who recently served as commander of the department's training division, looked at a photo of Chauvin on Floyd’s neck and told the court that it was not in line with department training. “I don’t know what kind of improvised position that is,” she said. “It's not what we train.”  Tuesday: Four police officials testified in court. Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Jody Stiger, a use-of-force expert, testified that the force used by Chauvin on Floyd was excessive. Minneapolis Police Lt. Johnny Mercil, a use-of-force instructor with the department's training unit, said Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck is not a trained neck restraint tactic. Minneapolis Police Officer Nicole Mackenzie, a medical response coordinator, testified that officers are required to render first aid and request emergency services when someone needs medical help. Chauvin took a 40-hour course on crisis intervention training in 2016 in which actors portrayed people in crisis and officers had to de-escalate the situation, said Minneapolis Police Sgt. Ker Yang, the department's crisis intervention training coordinator. Wednesday: Several investigators and forensic scientists testified about what they found at the crime scene, including Floyd's blood stains and a few white pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine. A Los Angeles Police Department use-of-force expert hired by the prosecution testified that Chauvin had used excessive and deadly force on Floyd when none was needed. The special agent who led the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigation into Floyd's death also struggled to make sense of a short phrase Floyd said last May as Derek Chauvin kneeled on him. Thursday: Prosecutors shifted into the third phase of their case and focused on the medical analysis of Floyd's cause of death. A renowned pulmonary critical care doctor testified Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen\" when Chauvin pinned him to the street and restricted his ability to breathe. Also on Thursday, another doctor seconded Tobin's conclusion and a forensic toxicologist discussed the drugs found in Floyd's system. The jury in Derek Chauvin's trial has heard from multiple witnesses so far, and they've been shown bystander and police footage of George Floyd's final moments.  If convicted, Chauvin could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder, and up to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. The charges are to be considered separate, so Chauvin could be convicted of all, some or none of them. While the jurors are unnamed and unseen on camera, we do know basic details about them. Here's what we know about the jury: Five men and nine women were chosen to serve on the jury during the trial in Minneapolis.  Of the 14 jurors, eight are White, four are Black and two are mixed race, according to how the court says the jurors identified themselves. The jury selection process began March 9 at the Hennepin County Government Center and wrapped up exactly two weeks later.  The panel is made up of 12 jurors and two alternates, Judge Peter Cahill said. The jurors all come from Hennepin County, which is demographically about 74% White and 14% Black, according to census data. The prospective jurors previously completed a 16-page questionnaire that asked for their personal thoughts on Black Lives Matter, policing and other topics. In court, each person was sworn in and then questioned one-by-one in a process known as voir dire. The juror's name, address and other information are kept anonymous. Eric Nelson questioned the prospective jurors for the defense, while Steve Schleicher questioned them for the prosecution. Read more about about the jury here. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker, who performed the autopsy of George Floyd, is expected to testify this morning. Jurors heard testimony yesterday from three expert witnesses for the prosecution, including a pulmonologist who said Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen.\" An emergency medicine physician with specialized training in forensic medicine, also testified and told the court that there was no evidence that Floyd had a heart attack. He said Floyd died because of a lack of oxygen in his body. It is day 10 of testimony in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged in the death of George Floyd. A series of witnesses took the stand in court yesterday during the prosecution's portion of the trial. If you're just reading in, here's what happened in court yesterday: Dr. Martin Tobin, a physician in pulmonary and critical care medicine, testified after having reviewed the medical records in the Floyd case. \"Mr. Floyd died from a low level of oxygen,\" Tobin testified. \"And this caused damage to his brain that we see and it also caused a PEA arrhythmia, that caused his heart to stop.\" PEA means pulseless electrical activity, \"which is a particular form of abnormal beat of heart — an arrhythmia,\" he explained. He also shared his opinion on the cause for the low level of oxygen in Floyd. \"The cause of the low level of oxygen was shallow breathing. Small breaths. Small tidal volumes. Shallow breaths that weren't able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas of the lungs that get oxygen into the blood and get rid of the carbon dioxide.\" Tobin also testified that fentanyl did not have an effect in \"causing depression of the respiratory centers\" in Floyd. Tobin said that with fentanyl, Floyd's respiratory rate should have been 10, instead the rate was at 22, which is normal. \"Basically it tells you that there isn't fentanyl on board that is affecting his respiratory centers. It's not having an effect on his respiratory centers,\" Tobin told the prosecution. Tobin noted that the normal range for a respiratory rate is between 12 and 22. Tobin testified that Floyd's respiratory rate was 22 just before he lost consciousness. Dr. William \"Bill\" Smock, emergency medicine physician with specialized training in forensic medicine, testified that Floyd died because of a lack of oxygen in his body. \"Mr. Floyd died from positional asphyxia. It is a fancy way of saying he died because he had no oxygen left in his body,\" Smock said. \"When the body is deprived of oxygen, in this case from his chest pressure and back, he gradually succumbed to lower and lower levels of oxygen until it was gone and he died.\" Smock also discussed the nature of strangulation and whether bruising is something that always occurs. \"You can be fatally strangled, die of asphyxia, and have no bruising. The presence or absence of a bruise on a human body, is dependent upon a multiple different variables. How much pressure is applied? How is that pressure applied? How frequently is that pressure applied?\" Smock said. Dr. Daniel Isenschmid testified that fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in the blood taken from Floyd at the hospital. Floyd’s fentanyl concentration was 11 nanograms per milliliter, Isenschmid said. Norfentanyl, a drug that it breaks down into, was recorded at a level of 5.6, he said.      The norfentanyl concentration could indicate fentanyl was taken and then some of it had already broken down, or it could indicate someone took a dose of the drug, then later took another dose, Isenschmid explained.   The impact of fentanyl on someone can vary person to person, due to tolerance, he said.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          From the passage of the 13th Amendment to the present, racial progress in America has often been prematurely celebrated. Fifty-six years ago this week, John Lewis was bludgeoned by Alabama state troopers on that bridge in Selma, alongside hundreds of heroic women, men and young people, for claiming a democratic birthright that continues to be denied to many in our own time. \"Bloody Sunday,\" as it came to be known, continues to haunt our national psyche. Selma, as it was unfolding and as we look back on it historically, illustrates the bottomless depths and expansive breadth of anti-Black racism. Malcolm X understood this, initially better than Martin Luther King Jr. He reminded Black folk, quite correctly, that full access to democracy was something they never had and warned them it was something they would likely never get. For many, that remains true today. These truths may not get someone elected, but they are the only chance we have to confront the great historic and contemporary evils that continue to plague us and the world. Bloody Sunday should not be remembered as a triumph of the American spirit. It is a tragic emblem of America's stubborn, violent failure to recognize Black humanity. The nation still doesn't recognize it. And it's not just overt racists or the Republican Party. It. Is. The. Entire. Nation. That is the hardest lesson of Selma, one evident in the latest round of national cruelty to deny Black citizenship and dignity. The scores of voter suppression measures primarily targeting Black voters in Georgia and other states since the Peach State's January 5, 2021 Senate run-off races should be acknowledged for what they are: old-fashioned anti-Black racism whose origin goes back to Reconstruction. While Americans should rightfully applaud (and many are) the voter rights advocacy and organizing done by Stacey Abrams, the voter education campaign waged by the WNBA and LeBron James' continued investment in protecting the franchise for African Americans, the fact that they have to do such work almost 60 years after the Voting Rights Act is a national tragedy. James' \"More Than a Vote\" campaign of voter education, information and protection is laudatory civic action. But just imagine the kind of investments someone with James's resources and dedication might be able to make in an America with full and fair voting rights access for all. That so many are still spending precious energies, resources and time on something as basic as voting rights underscores the vulnerability of Black citizenship in our own time. It also highlights our collective moral and political failure to come to terms with Selma's enduring significance. If we view the civil rights era as a national bedtime story, complete with a beginning, middle and happy ending, then Selma offers a dramatic third-act victory that helped propel the triumph of the first Black president 43 years later. But American history is never that simple. Popular myths about national racial progress treat the blood spilled in Selma as providing a symbolic sacrifice that permanently enshrined Black citizenship and dignity in the national consciousness. As we have all seen in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision that gutted voting rights enforcement, this is patently false. The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act is the best legislative antidote against this new campaign of legalized voter suppression. Passed in the House of Representatives in 2019, the legislation restores voter rights protections stripped by the Supreme Court and will ensure nationwide voting rights access. It is no accident that the White siege at the US Capitol building took place the day after Black voters in Georgia helped elect the first Black senator and gave Democrats a razor-thin Senate majority. The vote is one of the most important tools in a democracy to change social and political conditions. Yet the vote is only the beginning, the tip of the spear of the kind of deep citizenship and civic action that propels social justice and human progress. Every inch of ground gained (Senate seats, the White House, the very prospect of bills like the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act or HR1, the For the People Act) prompts inevitable, insidious backlash. Efforts to build a truly beloved community in America require more than the vote but can only truly begin in earnest with free and unfettered voting rights for all Americans. The most pernicious aspect of contemporary voter suppression measures winding their way through state legislatures is the way in which they promote former President Donald Trump's false allegation of voter fraud as a political, legislative, and policy effort to, once again, deny Black voters their just due. Contemporary voter suppression efforts are simply updated disenfranchisement techniques first institutionalized during the 19th century and now, through the assistance of the former president, the Republican Party and right-wing media outlets, buffed and polished to a high gloss that normalizes anti-Black racism through lies about voter fraud and cheating inevitably occurring wherever Black votes are cast. But what voting rights advocates characterize as voter suppression doesn't begin to do justice to the moral and political turpitude underway, nor does it reflect the cascading reverberations that such naked racism against Black folk has on our larger body politic. By forever placing Black people in the position of having to defend their fundamental citizenship rights, the racism behind these political assaults helps to -- in the eyes of the public and institutions in our democracy -- negate the very idea of Black humanity. Black people remain, as ever, the ground zero to a national discourse around race, identity, and whose lives matter, whose lives don't, and why. How can Black folk expect dignity and citizenship in a nation that permits continued attacks on their fundamental right to access the primary vehicle for social, political, and economic change? That unanswered question continues to haunt America. It deserves special and sustained attention this week as we grapple with commemorations of Selma as a signpost of premature racial progress and celebration, rather than a significant chapter in America's still unfinished national political saga.   \n",

              "      <td>A new Gallup poll finds that the percentage of Americans who are social distancing is declining. Fewer Americans said they have avoided events with large crowds (62%), traveling (57%), public places (48%) and small gatherings (45%) in the seven days before being asked by Gallup than at any point since the middle of March 2020, when the pandemic first became a reality for many Americans. This poll is backed up by a late March Axios/Ipsos poll, which showed more and more Americans are willing to take part in activities outside of the house. It's also backed up by travel data such as that from the TSA about how many Americans are flying every day. What's the point: The polling and real world data clearly shows that Americans are starting to come out of their pandemic shells, as state governments loosen restrictions. While plenty of Americans are doing so as they become vaccinated against Covid-19, many are doing so regardless of vaccination. This drop in social distancing is occurring as new cases of Covid-19 are beginning to rise. Indeed, the way some Americans are behaving and the ongoing transmission of the virus reflect a world in which Americans are clearly tired of thinking about a pandemic that is unfortunately very much still with us. Scarily, the people who are putting themselves at the most risk through a lack of social distancing are the people who are the least likely to get vaccinated. For example, just 22% of those who say they'll never get vaccinated say they have avoided public places in the last week compared to 54% of those who are fully vaccinated, according to Gallup polling. There is a partisan angle to this risky behavior too. Republicans were nearly twice as likely (60%) in a late March Ipsos poll to say they have eaten out in the previous week than Democrats (33%). Republicans (62%) were also more likely to say they have visited friends or relatives in the past week than Democrats (38%). This comes even as more Democrats (40%) said they have been vaccinated compared to 27% of Republicans in Gallup's last poll. The issue with fewer Americans social distancing is that the pandemic isn't over. While case counts were falling for the past few months in the US, the decline has clearly stopped. New case counts are rising now and stand at well north of 50,000 in the seven day average. Hospitalization rates, which had been declining and tend to be a lagging indicator of cases, are now pretty much flat at around 40,000. Some parts of the country have it worse. In Michigan, for example, cases and hospitalizations have been up over 100% from where they were the past few weeks. New York's case rate is rising rapidly as well. In some ways, though, it shouldn't be surprising that Americans are taking their foot off the pedal when it comes to social distancing. Many have been social distancing for a year, and their news habits clearly indicate a shift in interest from thinking about the pandemic. For example, fewer people are searching about the coronavirus on Google since March 2020. At the same time, just 31% of Americans told the Pew Research Center in March of this year that they are following news about the coronavirus very closely. That's the lowest of the entire pandemic and is seen across party lines. The shift in news interests was reflected well during President Joe Biden's news conference in March. Although Biden addressed the coronavirus in his opening remarks, not a single question was asked to him on the topic specifically. Some Americans do seem to recognize the pandemic isn't over. The issue of the coronavirus is still ranked as the top problem by 25% of the public in Gallup polling. The Gallup poll roughly matches the last Ipsos poll in which 22% of Americans said they were extremely concerned about the pandemic. Matching their social distancing behaviors, Democrats (35%) were far more likely to say they were extremely concerned than Republicans (10%). Still, even among Democrats, the percentage who are extremely concerned is down more than 10 points in the last two months. Hopefully, even as Americans' concerns about the virus are dropping, enough Americans stay vigilant and get vaccinated soon so that before long, the virus won't be a major problem.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Virginia and New Jersey this week joined other Democratic-led states moving ahead with new laws that would expand voting access -- a stark contrast to the Republican rush in statehouses across the country to make voting more difficult. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, which has tracked voting measures across the country, 843 bills that would expand voting access, largely offered by Democrats, have been introduced in 47 states. Republican lawmakers have introduced 361 restrictive bills in a different set of 47 states. Texas, Arizona and Georgia -- states that are competitive in presidential elections, but where Republicans have full control of statehouses -- have seen the largest numbers of restrictive bills introduced, according to the Brennan Center. The crush of new voting rules comes after former President Donald Trump's lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election ignited a new, fiercely partisan flame under the fundamental issue of voting access. There are rare exceptions: Kentucky's Republican-controlled legislature this week passed bipartisan voting reform legislation, sending to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's desk a bill allowing no-excuse in-person early voting on Thursday through Saturday in the week before an election, but backing away from the emergency expansion of mail-in voting that took place last year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Largely, though, states that have expanded voting access are controlled by Democrats. And those that are making voting harder -- Georgia and Iowa already have new laws on the books; Arizona, Florida, Texas, Michigan and other key states are currently advancing bills that would impose new restrictions -- are led by Republicans or, in Michigan's case, have a GOP-controlled legislature that plans to circumvent the Democratic governor. A number of those GOP measures would even prohibit Democratic-led counties, such as Harris County, the largest in Texas and home of Houston, from implementing their own efforts to ease voting access. \"Your access to the ballot depends a lot on where you live,\" said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under Law, \"and the divide is growing.\" It's part of the reason voting rights activists and Democrats have pushed to establish baseline voting rules for all Americans. But those proposals, including the House-passed \"For the People Act,\" which would expand early voting, allow same-day registration, require automatic voter registration, ease ID requirements and more, has not attracted enough Republican support to clear the Senate. Rising partisanship The rush to change voting laws and the heightened attention both parties' bases are paying to the issue shows the hyper-partisan nature of what could be the most significant battle over voting access since the civil rights era. It's a departure from a more recent period in which some overhauls of voting laws were implemented with bipartisan support. Early shifts to mail-only voting, for example, occurred in Republican-dominated Utah and in Oregon, where the change was backed by GOP lawmakers. Previous expansions of voting access often happened \"in what we would deem non-competitive states,\" including traditionally red states such as Alaska, which has automatic voter registration, Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections at Common Cause, said in an online briefing with journalists Wednesday. But following Trump's falsehoods about election fraud, \"what we are now seeing is that any state, that is, you know, Republican-controlled, is trying to move forward on voter-suppression measures, and many Democratic states ... saw the greater outcomes from the last election -- greater turnout and access -- and are moving forward with expansions.\" That's not true in every single state, she said, but \"we are seeing trends, and they are often breaking down\" along partisan lines. What Democratic-led states are doing In Washington, the state legislature has sent to Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee's desk a bill that would automatically restore the voting rights of people convicted of a felony once they are released from prison. The measure was approved despite Republicans' objections to restoring the voting rights of those who are on parole or probation. In Delaware, the state Senate has approved a bill to automatically register voters when they visit the Department of Motor Vehicles. That bill now heads to the House. Virginia -- where Democrats won control of the Senate in late 2019, giving the party its first majority in both chambers of the legislature since 1994 -- has been the most aggressive in expanding voting access. The state in recent months has repealed its voter ID law, made Election Day a holiday, allowed 45 days of no-excuse absentee voting and established automatic voter registration for anyone who obtains a driver's license. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam last month took executive action to immediately restore former felons' voting rights as soon as they complete their prison terms, a move that will immediately apply to more than 69,000 formerly incarcerated Virginians. Northam this week also approved the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, which would make the state the first to enact its own version of the federal Voting Rights Act. He made minor technical changes to the measure, which must be approved by the legislature before it becomes law. The measure would require local elections officials to take public feedback or get advanced approval from the state's attorney general before making changes such as moving voting precincts. It allows the attorney general to sue over voter suppression, and prohibits racial discrimination or intimidation related to voting. \"At a time when voting rights are under attack across our country, Virginia is expanding access to the ballot box, not restricting it,\" Northam said in a statement. Lawmakers in New Jersey have sent the state's Democratic governor two election bills that together would expand voting rights for residents in the state, as GOP-led states move to restrict access to the ballot box elsewhere. The first bill, given final passage from the state Senate on Thursday in a 28-8 vote, would allow residents to vote 10 days before a general election at specially designated polling sites, according to a release from the New Jersey Senate Democrats. The bill only applies to a June primary or a November general election, according to the lawmakers, but municipalities could adopt an early voting period by ordinance for other elections. A spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy said that the governor intends to sign the early voting bill on Tuesday. A second bill sent to the governor gives the county board of elections the ability to determine the location of ballot drop boxes, the lawmakers' release said. The state General Assembly and Senate gave final approval to the measure on Thursday.</td>\n",

              "      <td>The Tour Championship, which features the richest prize in golf, will be played in Atlanta as scheduled this September, the PGA Tour said in a statement to CNN. The announcement comes after Major League Baseball said its All-Star Game will be moved from Atlanta in response to new voter laws that critics see as a form of voter suppression. The PGA Tour acknowledged the controversy surrounding Georgia's recently passed laws, saying its intention to hold the Tour Championship in Atlanta \"should not be construed as indifference to the current national conversation around voting rights.\" \"The PGA TOUR fully supports efforts to protect the right of all Americans to vote and to eliminate any barriers that may prevent citizens' voices from being heard and counted,\" according to the statement. \"It is the foundation of our great country and a critical national priority to listen to the concerns about voter suppression — especially from communities of color that have been marginalized in the past — and work together to make voting easier for all citizens.\" Georgia's new election law introduces new impediments to voting, reducing the number of drop boxes in heavily African American areas and allows the state to intervene to assert control over the conduct of elections in Democratic counties. It shortens the time available for absentee votes and introduces new registration requirements that campaigners say are designed to target Black voters. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, says the new law makes it \"easy to vote and hard to cheat in Georgia.\" The Tour Championship has been played at Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club since 1998. The PGA Tour cited its commitment to providing charitable and economic benefits to the community as playing a major factor in its decision. \"In Georgia, this commitment has resulted in more than $38 million generated for local charitable organizations since the TOUR Championship — our season-ending event — moved to Atlanta in 1998,\" the PGA Tour said. \"The TOUR Championship's commitment to East Lake has helped our partners transform distressed neighborhoods into healthy and thriving ones, which is a key to ending the cycle of intergenerational poverty.\" The 2020 Tour Championship featured a $45 million prize pool, with $15 million going to winner Dustin Johnson. This year's event is scheduled for September 2-5. Georgia's most prestigious golf event, the Masters, is scheduled to go ahead in six days at the Augusta National Golf Club amid calls from some to relocate or cancel the tournament. The Masters is run by officials of the private golf club in Augusta. They have not responded to CNN's requests for comment. Johnson also won the 2020 Masters, which was held in November after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.</td>\n",

              "      <td>When the coronavirus pandemic began, the challenge for Pfizer and BioNTech wasn't just developing a Covid-19 vaccine -- they also had to make it, and by the hundreds of millions. This was no small feat. Until the very end of last year, no mRNA vaccine had ever been authorized and no such vaccine had ever been manufactured to scale by any company. Pfizer has now shipped more than 100 million doses to the US and it said this week it has successfully met its goal of 120 million doses released and ready for shipment by the end of March. For Mike McDermott, Pfizer's president of global supply, the mission is still more doses. Billions of them. \"Our goal has been running 24/7, make as many doses as possible. I actually don't even have a production goal,\" McDermott told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta during an exclusive tour of its manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in March. \"Our goal is to produce as much as possible to get to 2 billion doses this year as soon as possible.\" Pfizer/BioNTech's global goal is 2.5 billion doses by the end of the year. Big gamble Pfizer met its first milestones with substantial upfront investment, and it had no guarantees. Pfizer was part of Operation Warp Speed as a potential supplier for Covid-19 vaccines and had a purchase agreement for an initial 100 million doses. However, the company didn't receive federal funding for the research or development of the vaccine. So while Pfizer could repurpose some of its equipment at its main manufacturing site in Kalamazoo, most of what's there now didn't exist a year ago. \"Pfizer has spent at risk, almost $2 billion on the overall program. From manufacturing, my team spent $500 million, before we even got out of clinical trials. So all completely at risk. We didn't know if we had a product that was going to work,\" said McDermott. Before Pfizer decided on its final vaccine candidate, it was looking into four different options. That meant McDermott and his team had to be ready to go in any direction. \"I think about like, we're going to have dinner tonight, and we need to get dessert ready, but I don't know what dessert we're having. So you just start buying ingredients,\" he said. \"Maybe we're making a cake, maybe we're making brownies. Let's bring in the standard materials that we need. So filling up this pantry was quite, quite expensive.\" One of the biggest rate-limiting steps of this production, according to McDermott, has been the availability of raw materials and specifically lipids, the fatty substance that safely houses the mRNA until it can get to our cells. \"Lipid nanoparticle hasn't been used in a large commercial product. So the lipid suppliers weren't very large. And so we work very closely with them to build more lipids capacity, and actually making lipids in this site in Kalamazoo, Michigan,\" said McDermott. The heart of mRNA Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine can simply be described as mRNA housed in a lipid coating, but the successful production of that by the millions all came down to a something the size of a quarter. \"The heart of this whole machine is what's called an impingement jet mixer,\" said McDermott as he is twirled it around his fingers. The impingement jet mixer, also known as the tea stirrer, works by simply pumping lipids in one side and mRNA in the other, forcing them together with 400 pounds of pressure. That's what creates the lipid nanoparticle which is essentially the vaccine. These aren't just any lipids, Pfizer/BioNTech had to design the right combination of four different lipids that would not only protect the mRNA on the way to cells, but then release the mRNA once it gets there. While the process of creating lipid nanoparticles is not new, McDermott said the challenge was scaling up this process. \"The first time somebody showed me this impingement jet mixer, I said, 'You can't be serious?' Like how could you put billions of doses through here? So my confidence level was actually quite low. Not that it could be done, I knew it worked at this scale, but how could you multiply it?\" McDermott's first thought was to go bigger, make a large-scale tea stirrer to allow more volume to pass through. When that didn't work, they ended up replicating the quarter-sized mixers and put technology in place to ensure efficiency in order to scale up production. \"There's a computer system that's running the whole apparatus that makes sure you have the precise amount of flow and pressure. And that allowed us to get more production out. Even though this size is small, we were able to really scale this up our original design for this machine. We're currently operating at four times the capacity.\" Make it modular Part of what has allowed Pfizer to continue to make room for these new formulation suites has been its strategy of using prefabricated construction. In its 1,300-acre foot Kalamazoo facility, Pfizer is installing around 13,000 square feet of modular rooms that are first built in Texas and then shipped to Kalamazoo. \"We've had planned to expand our formulation capacity. The question was, how can we do it quickly? If we built it wall by wall on site, it would have taken us a year. By doing it modularly, we could cut that in half,\" says McDermott. Moving each room into place is surprisingly easy. With the help of compressed air -- think of an air hockey table -- you can simply slide them into place. Then the rooms are ready to be connected to electricity, sterilized and put to use. With each of these improvements, Pfizer says it has gone from producing 3 to 4 million doses of vaccine a week to 13 million doses a week. They company expects to double that again by the middle of the year. That will mean roughly 100 million doses a month and the ability to hit its goal of 300 million total doses delivered to the US government by July. What's next McDermott says the last 12 months have been \"like nothing I've ever experienced in my career.\" \"As a kid, my dad worked for NASA,\" McDermott said. \"He was lucky enough to be in mission control in Houston when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon right at that amazing moment. \"I could never imagine having a moment like that in my life. Right? Like, what's the odds that something like that would ever happen again?\" Then came December 13, 2020 -- the day the United States' first coronavirus vaccine, the first step to end the pandemic, left the facility. \"The day we shipped the first doses out of this site, it rushed over me like that was that was my moment,\" McDermott said. \"That was our moonshot.\" But McDermott says vaccine supply is always on his mind, and they have to prepare for the future -- and that means coronavirus variants. Although there is no evidence people immunized with Pfizer's vaccine will be less protected against the current variants, the company has started testing a third dose of its current vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech say they are also in ongoing discussions with regulators about potentially testing a vaccine modified to protect against concerning variants in a Phase 1/2 study. The company's next giant leap is to be ready to get it to patients, if necessary. Pfizer's goal, McDermott says: To be able to develop a new variant-specific vaccine, get it through production and get it to patients within a matter of months.</td>\n",

              "      <td>When NASA astronaut Leland Melvin was in fifth grade, he found his calling to be a scientist -- by blowing up his living room. He calls it \"the big kaboom.\" Both of Melvin's parents were middle school teachers, and they were constantly encouraging and inspiring him to think outside of the box. His mother gave him a chemistry set that wasn't age-appropriate for a fifth grader and told Melvin to carefully read the instructions. He tossed the instructions aside, mixed the chemicals together and set off an explosion that burned a hole in her carpet, leaving it singed and frayed. She was livid, but the spark had been lit for Melvin. \"I had just liberated fire and brimstone by taking these two clear chemicals and putting them together, and that led me to becoming a chemistry major in college,\" Melvin said. That initial hands-on experience has remained with Melvin throughout his life, and it's something he recognizes as an important way to get kids involved in STEAM, or science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics, early on. It's one of the reasons Melvin teaches classes geared at kids in kindergarten through eighth grade as part of Varsity Tutors' Space Club, which kicked off soon after the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020. Melvin, along with NASA planetary geologist Raquel Nuno, theoretical physicist Brian Greene and space enthusiast Alyssa Carson, teach free, large-group sessions that explore all aspects of space in an after-school virtual program. Smaller sessions, called mission crews, that focus on areas of interest like the solar system, are also available for a fee. At the beginning of the pandemic, the team behind the tutoring company realized they had capabilities for large classes and wanted to offer students a productive way to fill their time at home, said Brian Galvin, chief academic officer at Varsity Tutors. Melvin taught some of the first classes, sharing his experiences as an astronaut and the possibility of humans going to Mars. He wore his flight suit as he talked kids through experiments and answered their questions -- including the ever popular query of how to go to the bathroom in space. The kids in Melvin's classes began to join in by dressing up as astronauts and building \"rocket racers,\" or little rockets made using household products and propelled by air. The classes are designed to be interactive and fun, with a challenge or call to action kids can follow up on, and three or four memorable facts they'll want to share with friends and family, Galvin said. \"Space, dinosaurs and animals are some of the compelling STEM gateways for kids, so we lead with curiosity and open-ended questions to get them thinking,\" Galvin said. Melvin was attracted to the idea of teaching these classes because they could be easily accessed by kids at home with an internet connection and computer or tablet, and students could learn from instructors with diverse voices and backgrounds. \"It's really about three things: access, opportunity and belief in themselves,\" Melvin said. \"We have to make sure kids get it, because every ZIP code does not have access and we have Katherine Johnsons in the wings waiting to do great things, but don't have that access to those opportunities. The opportunities are there, and we just need to keep pumping in that inspiration.\" Alyssa Carson will teach her class about the history of space travel on April 5. The 20-year-old wants to be the first person to go to Mars. She knew at 3 years old she wanted to travel to the red planet. Carson has a multitude of experience under her belt for someone her age, having attended Space Camp seven times among other enriching experiences that have certified her to make her an astronaut trainee and go to space. Her class focuses on both the history and future of human space travel, addressing the kids in her class as the \"Mars Generation,\" since they will witness humans reach Mars the same way people witnessed Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon in 1969. It's an exciting time to think about space, Carson said. The return of humans to the moon in 2024 through NASA's Artemis program, and all of the focus on Mars, means that the kids focused on learning about space now will have \"endless amounts of opportunities\" to pursue their areas of interest in the future, she said. \"This is really just unchartered territory,\" Carson said. \"For the first time ever in space, we're able to do more than one thing at a time in space. We can have astronauts living on the International Space Station, we can have NASA having plans of wanting to go to the moon and Mars. I want to encourage kids to pursue their dreams, discover different passions or maybe even spark a new one.\" Subscribe to CNN's Wonder Theory newsletter: Sign up and explore the universe with weekly news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Inspired by space For Space Club instructor Raquel Nuno, the fascination with space began when she was a little girl growing up in Portugal. Her birthday fell on the day when the Perseids meteor shower typically peaked. Nuno and her family would go to the beach and watch meteors streak across the sky. Nuno was filled with questions about space, so her parents, who painted ceramics, would take her to the planetarium and the library. One of her prized possessions remains a book on amateur astronomy that Nuno's dad bought her when she was young. Nuno and her family moved to the US when she was 11. Although she was interested in pursuing science, Nuno wasn't sure how to go about it. Her dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and Nuno wanted to help provide for him, so she went into the Air Force after high school. After she left the Air Force, Nuno rediscovered the book her father gave her and she was reminded of her childhood dreams. Nuno began attending community college, focusing on science and math, and started an internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. She worked with scientists and engineers who were coming up with mission concepts to answer questions about our solar system, as well as the types of instruments needed on spacecraft to help find those answers. \"It was at JPL that I discovered this field of planetary science,\" Nuno said. \"I didn't even know planetary geology was a thing. And I figured out this is exactly what I want to do: answering science questions.\" Nuno pursued an undergraduate degree in geophysics and space physics, and this year she's finishing up her doctorate at the University of Californa, Los Angeles. She also works on an instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the moon since 2009. Her expertise is in impact craters, so when she teaches classes, she has kids do meteor impact experiments, like dropping different size objects in sand to see the craters they create. Their excitement inspires Nuno to be more curious and to be unafraid to ask questions in her own work. \"They haven't lost their natural curiosity and wonder about the world,\" she said. When Nuno pictured a scientist as she was growing up, she thought of Bill Nye or Albert Einstein. \"But I didn't know what it actually meant to be a scientist,\" Nuno said. \"I really want to show kids that you don't have to look a certain way or act a certain way. If you have curiosity and if you want to do it, you can do it.\" Nuno acknowledges that she wasn't sure she would be good at science, and that fear almost stopped her from pursuing STEM. Her advice to kids is to give it a try, especially if they're passionate about it. \"There's so many questions left to answer and we need all kinds of people to come and help answer at different viewpoints,\" Nuno said. \"That's how we are going to discover the cosmos. Thousands of people make a mission work, and there's a place for everyone.\"</td>\n",

              "      <td>When news of the Covid-19 pandemic first broke, Brian Mask, a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, immediately saw the danger it posed to his tribe. \"I knew it was gonna be bad because we Natives, you look at the history, our immune systems are not built for a lot of stuff,\" said Mask, who lives on the Pearl River Reservation near Philadelphia, Mississippi. The coronavirus spread through his community last spring, along with a wave of confusion and fear. Deaths spiked going into the summer; the tribe lost 33 members in June alone. Mask's friend and fellow tribal member Marsha Berry also lives on the reservation, where many families live in multi-generational homes. She told CNN that early in the pandemic, as residents had to wait about a week for their test results, many unknowingly spread Covid-19 to parents and grandparents before learning they were positive. \"We didn't have any guidance, any type of Instruction on what to do. So, we kind of were left out to fend for ourselves,\" Berry said. Those who tested positive were often unprepared to quarantine for 14 days, without enough food, supplies or a support system at home. Mask's fiancé, Sandy Steve, shared the story of a mother of three in their community who was suffering from Covid-19. Her 7-year-old daughter had to continually wake her up to make sure she was still alive. \"First thing I thought about,\" Mask said, \"was (this is) going to affect that child for the rest of her life.\" The story angered Mask, but also inspired him to take action. He went on Facebook and \"said some things that I shouldn't have said,\" but that's when he also linked up with Berry, Steve, and another acquaintance Rian Willis to help. They decided to collect donated food and hygiene products for what was supposed to be a one-day drive last June, offering families exposed to the coronavirus much-needed supplies. They secured a former Dollar General location to collect the items, and Berry announced the donation drive on a Facebook Live video. The community's response was overwhelming. The group received far more donations than they were able to give away in one afternoon. Unable to fit the excess items in their homes, they turned the former Dollar General store into a temporary headquarters for their effort, which they named \"Honoring the Choctaw Spirit.\" Donations rolled in over the summer as the virus spread to more families. While the local Choctaw Health Center was the first stop for most tribal members, helicopters flew the sicker Covid-19 patients to a hospital in Jackson, Mississippi -- about 80 miles away. Mask said he would hear choppers flying over his house every night. Berry recalled the emotional toll of the constant airlifts. \"I remember sitting here so many times and just ... putting my hands over my ears so that I wouldn't hear the helicopters, because the helicopters came three or four times a day to pick up another tribal member,\" she said. \"The majority of [them] never made it back home.\" Mask has lost family members to the pandemic, including a cousin who was just three months younger than him; they shared a crib and grew up together. \"He was healthy ... and a week later, he's in the hospital with it. It just blows you away ... you talk to somebody one day and the next day they're gone.\" The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians claim about 11,000 members. As of March 18, they had lost 113 members. The tribe's cultural losses are staggering. Mask says they lost the wife of a former chief, storytellers, traditional dancers, and stickball players, which he describes as a game similar to lacrosse. \"We were in a constant state of grief,\" Berry said. \"Having to deal with death on a daily basis, we almost became desensitized. Our funeral rites were taken from us because we couldn't gather. We couldn't mourn.\" The group kept the donation drives going every Saturday through the summer. Eventually, as the numbers of new cases began to decrease, Mask and other tribal members returned to their jobs. Honoring the Choctaw Spirit then moved its effort online, creating a Facebook Group to connect with exposed families and allow them to request specific donations. After his overnight shift as a pit manager at the Pearl River Resort, Mask would return home for a few hours of sleep before driving deliveries to those in need. Nowadays, donation requests spread mostly through word of mouth or Facebook posts, Mask said. He is also running a drive to fill Easter Baskets for tribal children who lost loved ones in the pandemic. Mask acknowledges some tribal members are hesitant about getting the Covid-19 vaccine. He admits that he was scared, but given his work environment, he was glad to get it. Seeing casino patrons refusing to wear a mask frustrates him, he says, and he has a message for them: \"While you may wanna die, I have a responsibility to these people out here.\" Despite all the losses, Mask and Berry say they see a silver lining in this tragedy: their drives unified tribal members to help each other while reacquainting old friends and building relationships. Mask, who still makes deliveries to those affected by Covid-19, also gained a sense of personal satisfaction from this work. \"I didn't grow up the perfect person in the world or anything, but I went to sleep every night with a smile on my face knowing I'm going to heaven. That sounds stupid, but it's my mindset now.\"</td>\n",

              "      <td>The Biden administration on Thursday unveiled a large-scale effort to encourage Americans to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, rolling out its first national ad campaign and announcing a national network of community organizations, sports leagues and other leaders to boost confidence in the vaccines. The Department of Health and Human Services is spending $10 million to air four new TV ads this month, two administration officials told CNN, framing vaccination as a way for Americans to fight back against the pandemic and reclaim their lives with the slogan \"We can do this.\" One of the ads is in Spanish and another, narrated by Henry Louis Gates Jr., the prominent intellectual, author and filmmaker, is aimed at Black Americans. The rollout comes as the Biden administration prepares for the next phase of the US's vaccination effort, with vaccines becoming more accessible and more widely available. All adults are expected to be eligible to get their shot by May 1, putting concerns about vaccine hesitancy front of mind. Beyond TV ads, the administration's vaccine confidence campaign centers around efforts to equip trusted voices with the information and resources to tout the safety and efficacy of the coronavirus vaccine. The administration honed in on those efforts after research showed that Americans were most likely to rely on doctors and community leaders as they decide whether to get vaccinated. Nearly 300 organizations -- including doctors' groups, sports leagues, rural organizations, unions and religious groups -- have signed up to be part of that effort, which the administration is calling the COVID-19 Community Corps. The administration plans to provide those groups with weekly updates about the science behind the vaccines as well as talking points, factsheets and other resources to help people schedule their vaccine appointments. HHS and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are also launching new profile picture frames on Facebook to help Americans who have or plan to get vaccinated to encourage their friends and families. Facebook will promote the frames and encourage influencers to use them, HHS said in a statement. The Community Corps includes a slew of groups who could appeal to conservatives -- including NASCAR, evangelical Christian groups and veterans' organizations -- a demographic the administration is honing in on after several polls showed there are least likely to plan to get vaccinated. About 47% of people who supported Trump in the 2020 election said they would not get a coronavirus vaccine if it became available to them, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. The Community Corps also includes groups representing Black and Hispanic communities, groups that are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus due to high rates of preexisting conditions and high-risk, essential work. The ads released Thursday by the administration will air on Black and Spanish-language media platforms, in addition to airing on cable and broadcast networks. The Biden administration also announced plans last week to spend nearly $10 billion to expand access to coronavirus vaccines for hardest-hit and highest-risk communities, including $3 billion to strengthen confidence in the vaccine in those communities. Vice President Kamala Harris and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy are meeting Thursday morning with founding members of the Community Corps. Thursday's rollout is just one step in the administration's efforts to promote and increase confidence in the coronavirus vaccines. Congress allocated $1 billion toward that effort through the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that Biden signed into law last month.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Attorney Ben Crump spoke to CBS News about two families he is representing: the families of George Floyd and Daunte Wright.  Floyd was killed in May 2020 after Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, placed his knee on Floyd's neck while he pleaded, \"I can't breathe.\" Chauvin — who is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — is currently on trial. The 13th day of testimony will begin this morning. Wright was killed Sunday during a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota — which is about 10 miles away from where Chauvin's trial is playing out. “George Floyd’s family, about this time last year, was dealing with this unthinkable intrusion into their lives and now they’re having to tell Daunte Wright’s mother, father, his baby’s mother, what they’re going to have to endure,” Crump said. “The assault on his character, trying to assassinate his character after they assassinated his person, about how they’re going to have grieve in the public’s eye.” Crump said said he and Wright’s family don’t think the resignation of officer Kim Potter — who authorities say shot and killed Wright after a traffic stop Sunday — is “fair that she can kill him and say ‘I made a mistake' and then resign and keep all her benefits and pensions.” Wright's death Sunday during a traffic stop — which the former Brooklyn Center police chief said appeared to be the result of the officer mistaking her gun for her Taser — has sparked widespread anger. Potter resigned from the force yesterday. Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott told CNN Tuesday that Kim Potter — who authorities say shot and killed Daunte Wright during a routine traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota — submitted a letter of resignation from the Brooklyn Center Police Department. In a letter, Potter wrote that she \"loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability.\" Elliott said Potter decided on her own to resign from the police department. \"We did not ask her to resign. That was a decision she made,\" he said. At a news conference by Elliott Tuesday, people in the room voiced concerns that Potter resigned and was not fired. The mayor said he has \"not accepted her resignation\" and that his office is continuing to review the matter. \"We're doing our internal process to make sure that we are being accountable to the steps that we need to take,\" Elliott told reporters. Hundreds gathered for a third night of protests to express anger over the police killing of a Black man in a Minneapolis suburb as prosecutors could decide as soon as Wednesday whether to charge the officer authorities say shot him. The Washington County prosecutor is weighing charges for former Brooklyn Center police Officer Kim Potter in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Daunte Wright, he told CNN. \"I hope to have a charging decision by tomorrow,\" prosecutor Pete Orput said in an email Tuesday afternoon. \"I just received voluminous documents, and with enough coffee, I'll have something tomorrow.\" Wright's death Sunday during a traffic stop, which then-Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon said appeared to be the result of Potter mistaking her gun for her Taser, has sparked widespread anger.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Hennepin County's chief medical examiner and a forensic pathologist testified today in the trial of former officer Derek Chauvin. They detailed what they found during the course of examining George Floyd's death. Here's what they said today in court: Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County chief medical examiner who performed Floyd's autopsy, said he still classifies Floyd's death as a homicide, and that his opinion remains unchanged. He told the court that Floyd's heart disease and use of fentanyl were contributing factors to his death, but they were not the direct cause. Asked about the autopsy and Floyd's death certificate, Baker described the \"top line of the cause of death\" as \"what you think is the most important thing that precipitated the death.\" \"Other things that you think played a role in the death but were not direct causes get relegated to what's known as the 'other significant conditions' part of the death certificate,\" he said. \"For example, you know, Mr. Floyd's use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint. His heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint.\" Chauvin's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, has argued that Floyd died as a result of drugs and preexisting health conditions. And under cross examination, Baker said he believed those factors played a role. But Baker reiterated he stood by the cause of death he wrote on Floyd's death certificate and his finding that Floyd's death was a homicide, which to a medical examiner means his death was caused by another person and does not necessarily indicate guilt. Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas, who has worked as a medical examiner herself, including in the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office, and who was part of Baker's training, agreed with Baker's finding in the cause of death, adding she believed the \"primary mechanism of death is asphyxia or low oxygen.\" Because of the restraint and his position, she said, Floyd was \"unable to get enough oxygen in\" to support his body's functions. Thomas explained the technical wording of the medical examiner's finding in the cause of death, saying, \"What it means to me is that the activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr. Floyd's death. And that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint and the neck compression.\" \"There's no evidence,\" she later added, \"to suggest he would have died that night except for the interactions with law enforcement.\" Court is adjourned until Monday morning when testimony is expected to resume in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin. The medical examiner who ruled George Floyd’s death a homicide last year says due to the 46-year-old's underlying health conditions, his body was simply not able to survive being subdued by police.   “He has a heart that already needs more oxygen than a normal heart by virtue of its size and its limited in its ability to step up to provide more oxygen when there's demand because of the narrowing of his coronary arteries,” Dr. Andrew Baker, Hennepin County's chief medical examiner, told prosecutor Jerry Blackwell. “The law enforcement subdue will restrain to the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of that those heart conditions.” Baker explained to the jury in the trial of Derek Chauvin how he examined Floyd’s body to identify any injuries and found cuts and bruises on Floyd’s face and hands from the interaction with police.   “These are blunt force injuries, these are abrasions and lacerations, again, that's damage to the skin from blunt trauma. These would be entirely consistent with him, having been in an altercation with another person,” Baker testified.   He looked under the skin on Floyd’s back to see if there were any signs of bruising and found none. “Sometimes, fresh bruises can be difficult to see in some people, so we look underneath the skin to make sure we have a missed something,” he testified.   Baker did not photograph Floyd’s heart since it appeared normal, though the weight was slightly larger due to high blood pressure, he said.   “The weight of the heart is a very good predictor as to whether that heart is normal or not, people who have high blood pressure for a long period of time, their heart will actually get heavier, just like any muscle that’s worked hard. The heart will grow in response to that kind of stress,” Baker testified.   Floyd’s arteries were dissected looking for narrowing or blockages and significant hardening was found. “You should be seeing through a round hole in each of those but they're pretty severely narrowed,” Baker told the jury as they looked at photos of the dissected blood vessels. He said there was no sign of clots in his coronary artery and no damage to the heart muscle itself.   Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County chief medical examiner who performed George Floyd's autopsy, said he still classifies Floyd's death as a homicide which, in the medical world, is not an assignment of guilt or malicious intent necessarily. \"My opinion remains unchanged. It's what I put on the death certificate last June. That's cardiopulmonary arrest, complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression. That was my top line then and it would stay my top line now,\" Baker said during the trial of former officer Derek Chauvin today. In regards to any underlying medical conditions Floyd may have suffered from or what may have been in his system in May 2020, Baker said \"they are not direct causes of Mr. Floyd's death.\" \"They're contributing causes,\" he added. \"I would still classify it as a homicide today.\" The underlying heart disease George Floyd suffered from \"contributed\" but was not \"the direct cause\" of his death, Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner who performed Floyd's autopsy, testified in court today. \"I don't know that we specifically got to it, counselor, but Mr. Floyd also had what we call hypertensive heart disease, meaning his heart weighed more than it should,\" Baker said to prosecuting attorney Jerry Blackwell. \"He has a heart that already needs more oxygen than a normal heart by virtue of its size, and it's limited in its ability to step up to provide more oxygen when there's demand because of the narrowing of his coronary arteries.\" Baker went on to explain what Floyd's heart was likely put through in May 2020 during the incident with police. \"Now, in the context of an altercation with other people that involves things like physical restraint, that involves things like being held to the ground, that involves things like the pain you would incur from having your cheek up against the asphalt and abrasion on your shoulder, those events are going to cause stress hormones to pour out into your body like adrenaline,\" Baker added. \"The adrenaline will ask your heart to beat faster, it will ask your body for more oxygen so that you can get through that altercation. And, in my opinion, the law enforcement subdual restraint and neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions.\" Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner who performed George Floyd's autopsy, told the court he has \"no reason to believe\" Floyd's tumor – a paraganglioma – discovered in his pelvis had anything to do with his  death.  \"Short answer is, I don't feel Mr. Floyd's paraganglioma had anything to do with his death,\" Baker said.  \"What we're talking about is an incidental tumor I happened to find in his pelvis during the autopsy. I did look at it under the microscope. The likely diagnosis is a paraganglioma but I have no reason to believe that had anything to do with Mr. Floyd's death,\" he continued. Moments before, Baker made similar comments about Floyd's sickle cell trait. \"Sickle cell trait is carried by about 8% of Americans of African heritage. What it means is that one of the genes that codes for the beta chain of hemoglobin has an abnormal substitution in it. If you just have sickle cell trait, chances are you will go through life and never have any symptoms from it because you make plenty of normal hemoglobin,\" Baker told the court. \"So, it's really just a fluke that it got picked up at autopsy. In my opinion, it doesn't have anything to do with why he died,\" he added. Baker ruled Floyd's death last May was a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County chief medical examiner, testified today that George Floyd's autopsy revealed that he did not have have any prior heart damage before the incident in May 2020. \"Mr. Floyd had no visible or microscopic previous damage to his heart muscle,\" Baker said. Earlier today: Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, said the \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of law enforcement of Floyd was \"ultimately\" the immediate cause of death. \"This is a death where both the heart and lung stopped working. And the point is that it's due to law enforcement subdual, restraint and compression. That is kind of what ultimately is the immediate cause of death. It's the subdual, restraint and compression,\" Thomas said.  Asked by the prosecution to explain what the terms \"subdual restraint and neck compression\" mean, Thomas said: \"Those were activities by the law enforcement agency officers involved. Subdual is subduing someone, trying to restrain them. In Mr. Floyd's case, involved handcuffing him, his positioning on the ground, the prone position. The people kneeling on him. And the net compression is the knee on the neck specifically. Additionally, there was some back and other things being compressed by the officers.\"  Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner, testified today that George Floyd's autopsy revealed that he had suffered \"several injuries to his face\" in May 2020. \"And these were specifically taken to illustrate the injuries you see on the corner of his left eyebrow and on his left cheek,\" Baker said in response to being shown autopsy photos today in court of Floyd's body. \"You can see the bruising and the abrasion. That's fancy medical lingo for the big scrape on the left side of his forehead. You can see the scrape or the abrasion on the left side of his cheek. It's a very common for abrasions post-mortem to take on the dark black color. After death, the moisture in the abrasion on you or me isn't there any more and they tend to dry out and look more like what you see in the photo.\" Baker added: \"These would be entirely consistent with the left side of his face being pinned against the asphalt or road surface he was on the night before.\" Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker, who performed George Floyd's autopsy, told the prosecuting attorney that he did not view videos of Floyd's death before examining the body. \"I was aware at least one video had gone viral on the internet. But I intentionally chose not to look at that until I had examined Mr. Floyd. I did not want to bias my exam by going in with preconceived notions that might lead me down one pathway or another,\" Baker said. Baker ruled Floyd's death last May was a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" The medical examiner saw the videos upon completing the autopsy. \"One video I saw shortly after the autopsy, that was the one most of the public had seen through Facebook or other social media, the other videos such as the cub surveillance video and the body worn camera videos, I did not see until three or four days after the autopsy,\" Baker said. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker, who performed George Floyd's autopsy, has taken the stand. Baker ruled Floyd's death last May a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's official autopsy made no mention of asphyxiation as a cause of death, which has been a key pillar of prosecutors' case. The court has returned from a lunch break, and testimony has resumed in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin. Earlier today, forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas testified that the \"primary mechanism\" of George Floyd's death was \"asphyxia or low oxygen.\" She told the court she ruled out drugs as a factor in Floyd's death. Shareeduh Tate, George Floyd’s cousin, said that she thinks the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin is “going in the right direction.” “The testimony from the experts really drove home what we thought all along, is that, you know, his cause of death was from the neck compression and not from a drug overdose,” Tate said.  The family is “dealing with it as best that we can” as they re-live Floyd’s death through the trial, she added. Tate has said she's “pessimistically optimistic” about the trial, and she thinks many Black Americans who are watching the trial feel the same way.   “We know that it's not a foregone conclusion that we'll end up with a conviction,” she said. The first day of the trial stood out for her, she said, since that was the first time she saw the video of her cousin outside of Cup Foods.  Charles McMillan’s testimony also struck a chord with her, she said. McMillian, who was one of the first bystanders on the scene as Floyd was being taken into custody in May 2020, broke down on the stand during his testimony after watching footage of his arrest. “There’s been a lot of prayers and support for our family. But I would ask that there be for the same for these bystanders and these people who are testifying, but who are essentially having to relive the fact that they, you know, they watched this murder in real-time. So I really liked the way that he seemed to ... really connect with what was going on,” Tate said.   Hypothetical scenarios introduced in the murder trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin are “dangerous,” according to CNN legal analyst Laura Coates.  “Both prosecutors, but especially defense, have got to be very wary about using hypotheticals. Because it comes across to the jury that they're trying to be cute or they're being disingenuous or they just don't get what we're talking about,” Coates said.  While cross-examining forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas, defense attorney Eric Nelson asked her about George Floyd's heart disease and what the cause of death would be if police were taken out of the incident altogether. Earlier, Thomas testified that the \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of Floyd by law enforcement was \"ultimately\" the immediate cause of his death. “You're trying to distill this down in such a reductive way that you're losing all of the facts that are at issue in this case. So every time this defense counsel tries to raise hypotheticals that have nothing to do with the facts, he invites a new witness — not a fact witness, but an expert witness — to now revisit and remind the jury of what happened to George Floyd in his final moments,” Coates said.  For the first time during the trial, the seat reserved for a representative for Derek Chauvin's family was filled today by a woman, according to reports from two courtroom pool reporters. Deputies had previously removed the seat from the courtroom as no representative of the Chauvin family had attended the trial until this point. Pool reports note a deputy is sitting between the George Floyd and Chauvin family representatives. The two are not seen looking at each other.  The court has taken a break for lunch. Testimony is expected to resume after the break. Jurors in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin seem “relatively well-engaged” and “appear to be listening” to Friday morning's testimony from forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas, according to reports from two courtroom pool reporters. When Thomas told the court she believed “asphyxia or low oxygen” was the “primary mechanism” of George Floyd’s death, “nearly all jurors were seen writing this down.” A packet of photos from Floyd’s autopsy was passed out to jurors, pool reporters and spectators in court during Thomas' testimony Friday morning. The packets included “close up photos of his face, shoulders and hands. His body is brightly lit – almost portrait style. There is nothing outwardly clinical about the photos.” One pool reporter observed all jurors looking through the photos and “some are seen flipping ahead looking at all the images.” The Floyd family representative “didn’t have any obvious emotional reaction” to the packet of autopsy photos, but one pool reporter noted “he spent a long time staring at the first image, before thumbing through the remaining images.” One pool report included the following descriptions of the autopsy photos presented to jurors: “Exhibit 185 is a close-up photo of Floyd, a white tube appearing protrude from his mouth from emergency respiratory efforts. His face is scraped over left eyebrow and on left cheek. All the jurors are looking through the photos at this point, some are seen flipping ahead looking at all the images.” “Exhibit 235 is a close up of the abrasions on the left side of Floyd’s face taken from the side.” “Exhibit 188 is a photo of Floyd’s left shoulder with a large abrasion which Thomas tells the jury is evidence of Floyd trying to push himself up.” “Exhibit 187 is a photo of Floyd’s right shoulder, which shows some scrapes but not as large as the abrasion on Floyd’s left shoulder.” “Exhibit 189 is a photo of Floyd’s left hand, which is ringed by a large red mark. Thomas testifies this is from the handcuff. Jurors are looking at the photos as she speaks.” “Exhibit 190 is a photo of Floyd’s right hand, which shows a similar mark from a handcuff. Thomas points out scrapes on his knuckles and fingers which she tells the jury came from when he was reaching out towards the squad car tire and “push his body into a position again where he can breathe.”  Both pool reporters noted that for the first time during the trial, the seat reserved for a Derek Chauvin family representative is filled today by a woman. Deputies had previously removed the seat from the courtroom as no representative of the Chauvin family had attended the trial until this point. Pool reporters have not yet been able to identify the Floyd family representative in court Friday. The reports note a deputy is sitting between the Floyd and Chauvin family representatives. The two are not seen looking at each other.  A member of the jury in the Derek Chauvin trial was questioned Friday morning by Judge Peter Cahill about “some concerns expressed” over outside influences, according to reports from two courtroom pool reporters.   The questioning of juror took place on the record before testimony in the trial began Friday, but broadcast of video and audio was not allowed by the judge.  The woman juror told Cahill “she had turned on a television and briefly saw coverage” and “saw an image of the courtroom with a woman with dark hair.” The woman explained to the judge that her volume was off and she quickly turned off the TV, according to the report.  When Cahill asked the woman if she had any contact with her family about the case, the woman replied her mother-in-law had texted her and said, “Looks like it was a bad day,” according to one report. The second pool report differed and said the text was from the woman’s mother. The woman told the judge she did not respond to the text.  “Any book deal in the works?” Cahill asked.  “The woman became slightly flustered or surprised,” according to one report. “No, I don’t know how this case is going to go,” the woman responded. She reiterated she hasn’t talked to anyone about the trial.  According to the reports, after the woman left the courtroom, Cahill asked if attorneys wanted to make any motions. Defense attorney Eric Nelson declined. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher said he would like the record to note the woman’s demeanor. Cahill noted the woman seemed “surprised.”   Defense attorney Eric Nelson is now questioning forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas. Thomas testified earlier today that the \"primary mechanism\" of George Floyd's death was \"asphyxia or low oxygen.\" She told the court she ruled out drugs as a factor in Floyd's death. Thomas explained that Floyd's death was not \"sudden\" like you would get with methamphetamine. And it was not slow like you would see with fentanyl, where \"the death is slow, it's peaceful, they fall asleep,\" she said. The trial has resumed after a 20-minute break. Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas continues her testimony on the stand. The court is taking a 20-minute break. Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist will continue her testimony when court resumes. Before the recess, Dr. Thomas was being asked about George Floyd's manner of death and why she agrees with Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker's ruling that Floyd's death last May was a homicide. Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas said a “secondary mechanism\" in George Floyd's death is what she referred to as \"physiologic stress.” \"It's that kind of fear of life that I'm talking about for physiologic stress,\" she said, using an example of the feeling a person would experience when they narrowly avoid getting into a car crash or when they momentarily lose sight of their child on a crowded beach. She detailed what goes on in the body when this feeling arises, including more adrenaline, increased blood pressure, release of stress hormones and a racing heart. \"You start needing more oxygen in your muscles. You need to take more breaths. You need more oxygen for your heart rate because your heart is beating faster,\" she said. \"All of those physical things, those chemical things, can cause reactions in the body that put additional stress primarily on your heart but also on all of your body systems,\" Thomas added. The physiologic stress was a \"double whammy\" to Floyd's system, Thomas said: \"Mr. Floyd was already in a position where he was experiencing difficulty breathing and getting enough oxygen in his body. And on top of that, now, there's this physiologic stress that is putting increased demand on his heart, increased demand on his lungs, increased demand on his muscles. So all of the things that he's using — his muscles, his strength, his body — to try and get himself into a safe position where he can breathe, those are being doubly stressed by the position that he's in, as well as the underlying chemical reactions that are going on in his body. So it's kind of a double whammy to his heart and lungs and muscles and his whole system,\" she said. In Floyd's case, she said, the \"primary mechanism [of death] I think is asphyxia, or low oxygen, and the secondary mechanism is this physiologic stress, but ultimately the cause of death is the subdual, restraint and compression.\" Physiologic stress cannot be observed on an autopsy, since it is a chemical reaction, Thomas explained. The jury was presented a set of photos by the prosecution that showed George Floyd's injuries. The images, the prosecuting attorney said, depict the points made by forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas about the \"superficial injuries\" that she believes support the conclusion of Floyd's cause of death. Earlier in her testimony, she said \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of law enforcement on Floyd was \"ultimately\" the immediate cause of death. The judge said the images of Floyd would not be shown in the monitors, but everyone in the court room will have access to them. This is what Thomas said about the injuries Floyd sustained during his arrest: \"So Mr. Floyd, had superficial injuries, what would be described as superficial injuries specifically on his face, shoulders, wrists. And what that does, is it supports what I saw in the videos, which is that he is being forcibly restrained and subdued and he's trying to move into a position by rubbing his face against the concrete cement of the ground, by pulling against his handcuffs. You can see the injury to his wrists from the handcuffs. And by pushing with his shoulder. And he also had some scrapes on his knuckles on his right hand. Again that, that was from him pushing to try to get into a position where he could breathe.\" Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas clearly told the court that she ruled out drugs as a factor in George Floyd's death. She explained that Floyd's death was not \"sudden\" like you would get with methamphetamine. And it was not slow like you would see with fentanyl, where \"the death is slow, it's peaceful, they fall asleep,\" she said. The prosecutor asked, \"Then based on your review of the video and application of the experience and knowledge, did you rule out drug overdose as a cause of death?\"  \"Yes,\" Thomas said.  The prosecutor continued: \"And that's an opinion you hear to a degree of medical certainty?\"  \"Yes,\" she said.  Earlier in her testimony Thomas told the court that it was the \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of law enforcement on Floyd that was \"ultimately\" the cause of his death. Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, said the \"subdual, restraint and compression\" of law enforcement of George Floyd was \"ultimately\" the immediate cause of death. \"This is a death were both the heart and lung stopped working. And the point is that it's due to law enforcement subdual, restraint and compression. That is kind of what ultimately is the immediate cause of death. It's the subdual, restraint and compression,\" Thomas said.  Asked by the prosecution to explain what the terms \"subdual restraint and neck compression\" mean, Thomas said: \"Those were activities by the law enforcement agency officers involved. Subdual is subduing someone, trying to restrain them. In Mr. Floyd's case, involved handcuffing him, his positioning on the ground, the prone position. The people kneeling on him. And the net compression is the knee on the neck specifically. Additionally, there was some back and other things being compressed by the officers.\"  If you put all of those together, she continued, \"what it means to me, is that the activities of the law enforcement officers resulted in Mr. Floyd's death. And that specifically those activities were the subdual, the restraint and the neck compression.\"  Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, said the \"primary mechanism\" of George Floyd's death was \"asphyxia or low oxygen.\"  Thomas said she agrees with the determination from Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker — who performed Floyd's autopsy — on the cause of death, which was \"cardiopulmonary complicating law enforcement subdual restraint and neck compression.\" \"This is not a sudden cardiac death, a sudden cardiac arrhythmia. This is a death where both the heart and lungs stopped working. And the point is that it's due to law enforcement subdual, restraint and compression. That is kind of what ultimately is the immediate cause of death,\" she said. Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, is now testifying. Asked by the prosecuting attorney to describe her field of expertise, she said: \"Forensic pathologists, is a branch of pathology, branch of medicine, where medicine and law overlap. So, it could be anything with a medical and legal component, could be toxicology, in some cases, it may involve living patients. But as I practice, and as most forensic pathologists practice, involves what's called, medical legal, death investigation.\"  \"We don't directly treat patients. But we provide information to doctors who then do treat patients,\" she added later on in questioning. Thomas noted that she is not being paid for her time and service in this case. \"I knew this was going to be important. And I felt like I had something to offer. I wanted to do what I could to help explain what I think happened,\" she said. She said she was asked to review \"a lot of material and come to an independent conclusion about what I thought the cause and manner of death were and the mechanism for that cause.\" Day 10 of testimony in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged in the death of George Floyd, just began. A forensic pathologist has taken the stand. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker, who performed the autopsy of George Floyd, is also expected to testify today. Baker ruled that Floyd's death last May was a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" Jurors heard testimony yesterday from three expert witnesses for the prosecution, including a pulmonologist who said Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen.\" Crucial testimony in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin is expected today when the medical examiner who performed George Floyd's autopsy takes the stand. Prosecutors intend to call Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker. He ruled Floyd's death last May a homicide, identifying the cause as \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that occurred during \"law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's official autopsy made no mention of asphyxiation as a cause of death, which has been a key pillar of prosecutors' case. Baker's testimony will come on the 10th day of Chauvin's trial, the culmination of a week filled with expert testimony by not only medical experts, but also policing experts who testified Chauvin violated policy and used excessive force on Floyd. A pulmonary critical care doctor testified Thursday that Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen\" when Chauvin pinned him to the street with his knee, restricting Floyd's ability to breathe. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, third-degree murder and third-degree manslaughter charges. Why these testimonies matter: The medical analysis is important to the prosecution's case that Chauvin was a substantial cause of Floyd's death when he put his body weight on Floyd's neck and back for over nine minutes – causing death by \"positional asphyxia.\" Chauvin's defense attorney Eric Nelson has argued that Floyd died of a drug overdose and preexisting health conditions. We expect another big day of testimony today, with the medical examiner who performed George Floyd's autopsy taking the stand. A renowned pulmonary critical care doctor testified Thursday morning that George Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen\" when former police officer Derek Chauvin pinned him to the street and restricted his ability to breathe. \"This caused damage to his brain that we see, and it also caused a PEA arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop,\" Dr. Martin Tobin of Chicago testified, referring to pulseless electrical activity, a type of cardiac arrest. \"The cause of the low level of oxygen was shallow breathing,\" he added. \"Small breaths. Small tidal volumes. Shallow breaths that weren't able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas of the lungs that get oxygen into the blood and get rid of the carbon dioxide.\" He identified four main reasons why Floyd died: The handcuffs and the street acting as a \"vise\" Chauvin's left knee on his neck Floyd's prone position Chauvin's right knee on Floyd's back, arm and side Combined, these limited Floyd's ability to expand his lungs and narrowed his hypopharynx, a part of the throat that air passes through. Floyd's preexisting health conditions and drug use were not relevant to his death, Tobin said. \"A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died,\" he said. Tobin's testimony came on the ninth day of the trial as prosecutors shifted into the third phase of their case, focusing on the medical analysis of Floyd's cause of death.  Read more about how the trial unfolded yesterday here. The trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin will enter day 10 of testimony today. We're expecting the prosecution to call more witnesses. Here's a recap of what's happened so far this week: Monday: Three witnesses took the stand. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck was not a trained tactic and was a violation of the policies around de-escalation, objectively reasonable use of force and requirement to render aid. Dr. Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld treated Floyd and said the \"more likely possibility\" of Floyd's cardiac arrest was hypoxia, or lack of oxygen. Minneapolis Police Inspector Katie Blackwell, who recently served as commander of the department's training division, looked at a photo of Chauvin on Floyd’s neck and told the court that it was not in line with department training. “I don’t know what kind of improvised position that is,” she said. “It's not what we train.”  Tuesday: Four police officials testified in court. Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Jody Stiger, a use-of-force expert, testified that the force used by Chauvin on Floyd was excessive. Minneapolis Police Lt. Johnny Mercil, a use-of-force instructor with the department's training unit, said Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck is not a trained neck restraint tactic. Minneapolis Police Officer Nicole Mackenzie, a medical response coordinator, testified that officers are required to render first aid and request emergency services when someone needs medical help. Chauvin took a 40-hour course on crisis intervention training in 2016 in which actors portrayed people in crisis and officers had to de-escalate the situation, said Minneapolis Police Sgt. Ker Yang, the department's crisis intervention training coordinator. Wednesday: Several investigators and forensic scientists testified about what they found at the crime scene, including Floyd's blood stains and a few white pills containing fentanyl and methamphetamine. A Los Angeles Police Department use-of-force expert hired by the prosecution testified that Chauvin had used excessive and deadly force on Floyd when none was needed. The special agent who led the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigation into Floyd's death also struggled to make sense of a short phrase Floyd said last May as Derek Chauvin kneeled on him. Thursday: Prosecutors shifted into the third phase of their case and focused on the medical analysis of Floyd's cause of death. A renowned pulmonary critical care doctor testified Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen\" when Chauvin pinned him to the street and restricted his ability to breathe. Also on Thursday, another doctor seconded Tobin's conclusion and a forensic toxicologist discussed the drugs found in Floyd's system. The jury in Derek Chauvin's trial has heard from multiple witnesses so far, and they've been shown bystander and police footage of George Floyd's final moments.  If convicted, Chauvin could face up to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder, up to 25 years for third-degree murder, and up to 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. The charges are to be considered separate, so Chauvin could be convicted of all, some or none of them. While the jurors are unnamed and unseen on camera, we do know basic details about them. Here's what we know about the jury: Five men and nine women were chosen to serve on the jury during the trial in Minneapolis.  Of the 14 jurors, eight are White, four are Black and two are mixed race, according to how the court says the jurors identified themselves. The jury selection process began March 9 at the Hennepin County Government Center and wrapped up exactly two weeks later.  The panel is made up of 12 jurors and two alternates, Judge Peter Cahill said. The jurors all come from Hennepin County, which is demographically about 74% White and 14% Black, according to census data. The prospective jurors previously completed a 16-page questionnaire that asked for their personal thoughts on Black Lives Matter, policing and other topics. In court, each person was sworn in and then questioned one-by-one in a process known as voir dire. The juror's name, address and other information are kept anonymous. Eric Nelson questioned the prospective jurors for the defense, while Steve Schleicher questioned them for the prosecution. Read more about about the jury here. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker, who performed the autopsy of George Floyd, is expected to testify this morning. Jurors heard testimony yesterday from three expert witnesses for the prosecution, including a pulmonologist who said Floyd died from a \"low level of oxygen.\" An emergency medicine physician with specialized training in forensic medicine, also testified and told the court that there was no evidence that Floyd had a heart attack. He said Floyd died because of a lack of oxygen in his body. It is day 10 of testimony in the trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged in the death of George Floyd. A series of witnesses took the stand in court yesterday during the prosecution's portion of the trial. If you're just reading in, here's what happened in court yesterday: Dr. Martin Tobin, a physician in pulmonary and critical care medicine, testified after having reviewed the medical records in the Floyd case. \"Mr. Floyd died from a low level of oxygen,\" Tobin testified. \"And this caused damage to his brain that we see and it also caused a PEA arrhythmia, that caused his heart to stop.\" PEA means pulseless electrical activity, \"which is a particular form of abnormal beat of heart — an arrhythmia,\" he explained. He also shared his opinion on the cause for the low level of oxygen in Floyd. \"The cause of the low level of oxygen was shallow breathing. Small breaths. Small tidal volumes. Shallow breaths that weren't able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas of the lungs that get oxygen into the blood and get rid of the carbon dioxide.\" Tobin also testified that fentanyl did not have an effect in \"causing depression of the respiratory centers\" in Floyd. Tobin said that with fentanyl, Floyd's respiratory rate should have been 10, instead the rate was at 22, which is normal. \"Basically it tells you that there isn't fentanyl on board that is affecting his respiratory centers. It's not having an effect on his respiratory centers,\" Tobin told the prosecution. Tobin noted that the normal range for a respiratory rate is between 12 and 22. Tobin testified that Floyd's respiratory rate was 22 just before he lost consciousness. Dr. William \"Bill\" Smock, emergency medicine physician with specialized training in forensic medicine, testified that Floyd died because of a lack of oxygen in his body. \"Mr. Floyd died from positional asphyxia. It is a fancy way of saying he died because he had no oxygen left in his body,\" Smock said. \"When the body is deprived of oxygen, in this case from his chest pressure and back, he gradually succumbed to lower and lower levels of oxygen until it was gone and he died.\" Smock also discussed the nature of strangulation and whether bruising is something that always occurs. \"You can be fatally strangled, die of asphyxia, and have no bruising. The presence or absence of a bruise on a human body, is dependent upon a multiple different variables. How much pressure is applied? How is that pressure applied? How frequently is that pressure applied?\" Smock said. Dr. Daniel Isenschmid testified that fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in the blood taken from Floyd at the hospital. Floyd’s fentanyl concentration was 11 nanograms per milliliter, Isenschmid said. Norfentanyl, a drug that it breaks down into, was recorded at a level of 5.6, he said.      The norfentanyl concentration could indicate fentanyl was taken and then some of it had already broken down, or it could indicate someone took a dose of the drug, then later took another dose, Isenschmid explained.   The impact of fentanyl on someone can vary person to person, due to tolerance, he said.</td>\n",

              "      <td>From the passage of the 13th Amendment to the present, racial progress in America has often been prematurely celebrated. Fifty-six years ago this week, John Lewis was bludgeoned by Alabama state troopers on that bridge in Selma, alongside hundreds of heroic women, men and young people, for claiming a democratic birthright that continues to be denied to many in our own time. \"Bloody Sunday,\" as it came to be known, continues to haunt our national psyche. Selma, as it was unfolding and as we look back on it historically, illustrates the bottomless depths and expansive breadth of anti-Black racism. Malcolm X understood this, initially better than Martin Luther King Jr. He reminded Black folk, quite correctly, that full access to democracy was something they never had and warned them it was something they would likely never get. For many, that remains true today. These truths may not get someone elected, but they are the only chance we have to confront the great historic and contemporary evils that continue to plague us and the world. Bloody Sunday should not be remembered as a triumph of the American spirit. It is a tragic emblem of America's stubborn, violent failure to recognize Black humanity. The nation still doesn't recognize it. And it's not just overt racists or the Republican Party. It. Is. The. Entire. Nation. That is the hardest lesson of Selma, one evident in the latest round of national cruelty to deny Black citizenship and dignity. The scores of voter suppression measures primarily targeting Black voters in Georgia and other states since the Peach State's January 5, 2021 Senate run-off races should be acknowledged for what they are: old-fashioned anti-Black racism whose origin goes back to Reconstruction. While Americans should rightfully applaud (and many are) the voter rights advocacy and organizing done by Stacey Abrams, the voter education campaign waged by the WNBA and LeBron James' continued investment in protecting the franchise for African Americans, the fact that they have to do such work almost 60 years after the Voting Rights Act is a national tragedy. James' \"More Than a Vote\" campaign of voter education, information and protection is laudatory civic action. But just imagine the kind of investments someone with James's resources and dedication might be able to make in an America with full and fair voting rights access for all. That so many are still spending precious energies, resources and time on something as basic as voting rights underscores the vulnerability of Black citizenship in our own time. It also highlights our collective moral and political failure to come to terms with Selma's enduring significance. If we view the civil rights era as a national bedtime story, complete with a beginning, middle and happy ending, then Selma offers a dramatic third-act victory that helped propel the triumph of the first Black president 43 years later. But American history is never that simple. Popular myths about national racial progress treat the blood spilled in Selma as providing a symbolic sacrifice that permanently enshrined Black citizenship and dignity in the national consciousness. As we have all seen in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision that gutted voting rights enforcement, this is patently false. The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act is the best legislative antidote against this new campaign of legalized voter suppression. Passed in the House of Representatives in 2019, the legislation restores voter rights protections stripped by the Supreme Court and will ensure nationwide voting rights access. It is no accident that the White siege at the US Capitol building took place the day after Black voters in Georgia helped elect the first Black senator and gave Democrats a razor-thin Senate majority. The vote is one of the most important tools in a democracy to change social and political conditions. Yet the vote is only the beginning, the tip of the spear of the kind of deep citizenship and civic action that propels social justice and human progress. Every inch of ground gained (Senate seats, the White House, the very prospect of bills like the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act or HR1, the For the People Act) prompts inevitable, insidious backlash. Efforts to build a truly beloved community in America require more than the vote but can only truly begin in earnest with free and unfettered voting rights for all Americans. The most pernicious aspect of contemporary voter suppression measures winding their way through state legislatures is the way in which they promote former President Donald Trump's false allegation of voter fraud as a political, legislative, and policy effort to, once again, deny Black voters their just due. Contemporary voter suppression efforts are simply updated disenfranchisement techniques first institutionalized during the 19th century and now, through the assistance of the former president, the Republican Party and right-wing media outlets, buffed and polished to a high gloss that normalizes anti-Black racism through lies about voter fraud and cheating inevitably occurring wherever Black votes are cast. But what voting rights advocates characterize as voter suppression doesn't begin to do justice to the moral and political turpitude underway, nor does it reflect the cascading reverberations that such naked racism against Black folk has on our larger body politic. By forever placing Black people in the position of having to defend their fundamental citizenship rights, the racism behind these political assaults helps to -- in the eyes of the public and institutions in our democracy -- negate the very idea of Black humanity. Black people remain, as ever, the ground zero to a national discourse around race, identity, and whose lives matter, whose lives don't, and why. How can Black folk expect dignity and citizenship in a nation that permits continued attacks on their fundamental right to access the primary vehicle for social, political, and economic change? That unanswered question continues to haunt America. It deserves special and sustained attention this week as we grapple with commemorations of Selma as a signpost of premature racial progress and celebration, rather than a significant chapter in America's still unfinished national political saga.</td>\n",

            "21  Through sport we learn about glory and defeat, the sacrifices made to be the best, the intoxicating joy of victory, and the pain of the near-misses. But sport can be much more than that; it can shine a light on injustice, it can educate; it can change minds. Over half a century after John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their gloved fists as they stood on the podium at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico, West Indies cricketers walked out into the heart of Southampton's Ageas Bowl for the opening day of the first Test match against England wearing one black glove each. Both teams took the knee before the start of play. The West Indies players raised their fists too. The sight of players, coaching staff, umpires and officials taking a knee was visually powerful, a continuation of athletes across the world drawing attention to, and supporting, Black Lives Matter since the brutal death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. However, the day will mainly be remembered for what happened away from the field, for a four-minute live monologue by Michael Holding, a former West Indies great and now a Sky Sports commentator, during one of the day's many rain delays. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features 'Unflinching masterpiece on race' His impassioned words forced viewers to pause and listen. The audience may have tuned in to watch cricket, a sport intertwined with British colonialism; what they got was a lesson in history and institutional racism. Holding, one of the game's finest pace bowlers, a member of the brilliant West Indies team of the 1970s and 1980s, talked about the lack of education around what Black men and women have achieved, the representation of Christ as a White man, the video of a White woman calling the police on a Black man who was birdwatching in Central Park, and the subconscious bias among pre-school teachers against Black students. English newspaper The Guardian described the broadcast as an \"unflinching masterpiece on race.\" The Daily Telegraph wrote that Holding's impassioned plea was \"the finest spells the ground has seen.\" Holding's monologue has had over six million views on Twitter. \"What people need to understand is that these things stem from a long time ago, hundreds of years ago,\" said the 66-year-old Jamaican. \"The dehumanization of the Black race is where it started. People will tell you that 'Oh it's a long time ago, get over it.' No, you don't get over things like that. \"[...] Everybody knows Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. Thomas Edison invented a light bulb with a paper filament; it burnt out in no time at all. Can you tell me who invented the filament that makes these lights shine throughout? Nobody knows because he was a Black man and it was not taught in schools. Lewis Howard Latimer invented the carbon filament to allow lights to continuously shine. Who knows that? \"Everything should be taught. I remember my school days; I was never taught anything good about Black people. And you cannot have a society that is brought up like that, both White and Black, that only teaches what is convenient to the teacher. \"History is written by the conqueror, not by those that are conquered. History is written by the people who do the harm, not by the people who get harmed. And we need to go back and teach both sides of history and until we do that, and educate the entire human race, this thing will not stop.\" 'I forced myself to watch' Holding's words had followed a recorded segment which featured Holding and Ebony Rainford-Brent, the first Black woman to play cricket for England, talking about their experiences of racism in the game. Rainford-Brent went on to point out that there are no Black members on the England and Wales Cricket Board, the UK's governing body, and no Black captains among the 18 counties that make up the top two tiers of English cricket's pyramid. The uncompromising half-hour of broadcasting was concluded by Holding's fellow commentator Nasser Hussain, the Indian-born former captain of the England team, considered as one of his country's most astute cricketing leaders. \"People will be tuning in and saying: 'Not this again,'\" Hussain said. \"All I'll say to those people who say 'not again,' I sat there six weeks ago and put Channel 4 news on and watched a Black man being killed in front of my eyes, and my natural reaction was to look away. \"And the next time that footage came on, because of the protests, I forced myself to watch because I felt something inside of myself say: 'You've been looking away too long.'\" West Indies captain Jason Holder said Holding's words had had an impact on him, telling reporters: \"I saw the interview with Mikey and I felt in my veins.\" On Thursday, a tearful Holding told Sky News' Mark Austin he was thinking about his parents during his emotional plea, revealing that his mother's family had stopped talking to her \"because her husband was too dark.\" Holding's fearsome bowling -- after leaving his hand the ball would come at batsmen in a blur -- had earned him the nickname \"Whispering Death.\" Once described as \"possibly the most beautiful athlete to grace a cricket field,\" by journalist and former player Mike Selvey, in retirement Holding has always been a wonderfully eloquent commentator. In the sociocultural documentary \"Fire in Babylon\" about the golden era of Caribbean cricket, beginning in 1975 and continuing into the early 1990s, Holding talks openly in a film about a generation of players who went on to crush the established powers, excelling in a sport which was used as an instrument of colonialism by the English. During a 15-year period, the West Indies, a team drawn from 15 countries with a shared history of slavery, racism and imperialism, of which many had won independence from the British in the 1960s and '70s, did not lose a Test series. It is still regarded as one of the finest teams in history. The film explains how the team's dominance had political ramifications, inspiring Caribbean people around the world, \"It was an eye-opener to come to England and see how much cricket meant to West Indians living in England and how they used it to lift themselves,\" Holding says. It was during the tour of England in 1976 that this West Indies team truly announced itself to the world. England's captain Tony Greig had irritated and offended, telling the BBC that he intended to \"make them grovel,\" a remark which had connotations of racism. Also of significance to the team was that the words were uttered by a South African-born player during the days of apartheid in the country of his birth. \"A whole other things needed defending, other than the cricket ball itself,\" says Antiguan batsman Vivian Richards, another of that era regarded as an all-time great, in the film. Though Holding has said he became aware of the political implications of the West Indies' success later on in life, that was not the case for every member of the team with Richards wearing a wristband in the colors of the Rastafarian movement. \"Green for the land itself,\" he says. \"Gold for the wealth that was stripped away. Red for the blood that was shed.\" 'Nothing can be changed until it is faced' If it wasn't already obvious after these last few weeks, Sky Sports and Holding have shone a light on how far society still must progress before there is equality for all. Holding highlighted the painful experiences of Black people, the oppression that still exists, as has British sprinter Bianca Williams this week. Williams has accused London's Metropolitan Police of \"racial profiling.\" She had been in a West London neighborhood with her partner, Portuguese 400-meter record holder Ricardo dos Santos, and their three-month-old son when they were stopped by police last weekend. Footage of the incident, posted on social media by the pair's trainer and Olympic gold medalist Linford Christie, appears to show two people -- although their faces aren't visible -- being pulled out of a car. When asked to step outside the car by a police officer, a man is heard asking \"For what?\" Once out of the car, two other officers approach the woman who tells them, \"He didn't do anything.\" The woman grows increasingly distressed and shouts: \"My son is in the car [...] I don't want you to look after him.\" Officers tell her to \"relax\" and \"get out of the car.\" Williams told CNN her first priority was the safety of her young son and brought into focus once again what parents of young Black children have to contemplate. \"We're raising a Black boy who's then going to be going to school by himself and he's going to be doing things by himself. We're going to have to get used to it and to teach him that ... he can be stopped by the police because of the color of his skin. It's just shocking that we have to tell our son this to be honest,\" Williams told CNN. Williams received an apology from the Met on Wednesday for \"distress caused\" but the organization did not apologize for the traffic stop itself. In the words of James Baldwin, which opened Sky Sports' exceptional coverage on Wednesday: \"Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\"   \n",

            "31  Former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly once uttered one of the most famous lines in the game: \"Some people believe football is a matter of life and death. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.\" He was joking, of course, but the events of the last few weeks have thrown into sharp focus what really matters in life. As a sports anchor at CNN, I've spent most of my career covering the triumphs and the trophies, the rivalries and results, but sport in the age of coronavirus now feels very different. I'm now second-guessing myself on the meaning of a game that used to be exciting -- does it even really matter? READ: 'What we really need to cancel is 2020,' says Lebron James as sport enters twilight zone As Covid-19 took hold in Europe, I've been leading off our daily \"World Sport\" show with a roll call of games or events that have been compromised, postponed or canceled. It's getting harder and harder to keep up; so rather than ticking through every single one, we simplified it with a graphic showing the sports impacted. At this point, it's pretty much all of them. There's another score that I wish I didn't have to keep, from 12 to 20, 200 to 450 and now more than 1,000. This isn't the score of a test match in cricket, it's the death toll in Italy. I don't sound much like a sports anchor anymore. READ: Sports stars unite to support 'heroes' helping vulnerable in coronavirus fight Watching these massive events toppled by a virus has been a sobering experience -- with every new update there's a creeping sense of foreboding. For any fans who have been paying attention to the bigger picture, the last few weeks have offered a preview of what might soon be knocking at their own back door. From baseball in Japan to soccer in Europe, games have been played in barren arenas, devoid of the fans who always breathe so much life into any sports event. Whereas before, you'd feel the energy of the crowd, now you can experience a game in forensic audio detail -- like the crack of a bat and its echo reverberating off folded plastic seats. As we have listened to players calling out to each other, big games no longer seem real, more practice than professional; it seems almost post-apocalyptic. READ: Italy suspends all domestic sport in bid to curb coronavirus Anybody who has ever worked in a broadcast sports department will tell you that it's fun, sometimes carefree, happy. Not now. And as a sports broadcaster, I now find myself thinking -- so what? Likewise, my production team feels it too. \"I don't even know what matters anymore,\" said our producer Sam Krumov at the completion of a recent show Sobering realities On Tuesday, I spoke with Tancredi Palmeri -- a well-known Italian football journalist. He's one of the most demonstrably passionate reporters in the game, but now he was talking to me from a country on lockdown. It hardly seemed appropriate to be talking about football and he ended the interview pleading with me to spread the word that Milan's hospitals need more ventilators to keep their patients alive. Professional sport is a global industry, worth billions of dollars. The athletes are the strongest of all of us, but the whole show has been slowly grinding to a halt. First Asia, then Europe and now the United States. At the weekend, the LA Lakers' star LeBron James scoffed at the idea of playing in an empty arena -- \"I do it for the fans\" -- but now he won't be playing at all. Literally, as I'm writing this, the NBA has just suspended the season. Which sports will be totally shuttered next? READ: Premier league enters uncharted territory as game postponed due to COVID-19 In Europe, it's becoming obvious that locking the doors might not actually achieve the goal of containing the spread of infection. The fans are getting together anyway, instead of congregating inside a stadium, supporters are joining together just outside. It happened at both Valencia and Paris this week -- Paris Saint-Germain even beaming images of the supporters onto the big screens for the benefit of the players on the pitch. On Wednesday, Liverpool's manager Jurgen Klopp angrily snapped at fans who were trying to high-five him and now that a top player, Juventus defender Daniele Rugani, has tested positive for the virus, one wonders if the Champions League and the Europa League can even be completed. In Italy and Spain, domestic football leagues had already been suspended -- possibly for the rest of the season. Doubts persist over the biggest soccer event on the continent, the 24-nation European Championships. The Tokyo Olympics, now something of an outlier, is the only event projecting with any degree of certainty that it's still \"business as usual.\"n What truly matters I was in a newsroom in London when the planes hit the Twin Towers on 9/11 and I can still remember the dissonance -- for just a moment -- of trying to care about sport while processing the broader magnitude of what was happening. I hadn't felt that way again -- until now. As was the case in September 2001, nobody can predict what is going to come next. I have always believed that sport has the power to lift, inspire and unite us. But it seems entirely possible that for a period of time in the near future, I could be the host of a sports show with no sport to report on. For the time being, we need to acknowledge that sports are far less important than a matter of life and death.   \n",

            "20  It was a moment that shocked European football. Christian Kabasele, who was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, scored for Genk against Standard Liege in October 2015 and celebrated with a monkey imitation. His celebration was in protest of the monkey chants he'd been subjected to by some Kortrijk fans in September 2015 in another Belgium Pro League game. The Belgium Pro League did not immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment, though the Royal Belgium Football Association pointed to projects that it has introduced to combat racism earlier this year. However, Kabasele, who now plays for Watford in the English Premier League, says the racist abuse he's received over social media is often worse than when he's been targeted in the stadium. READ: Why English football can't afford another 'lost generation' of Black coaches 'It's quite crazy' The 29-year-old has been a strong voice in the fight against racism given his experiences during his professional career. Kabasele says he's received numerous abusive posts on his personal social media accounts and the Watford player urged platforms to do more in tackling the issue. \"When you're in the stadium, the fact that you are surrounded by other people, you just disconnect your brain and you do something stupid,\" Kabaselse told CNN Sport back in March, before the interruption of the Premier League season -- due to the Covid-19 pandemic -- as he reflected on some fans' racist behaviour. \"But when you write something on Instagram, or on Twitter, you have time to think about what you are doing and it's worse than something happening in a stadium. \"It's quite incredible that somebody can think about doing this. Like this player did this so I will go on my phone and send him bananas or a monkey emoji. It's quite crazy.\" Kabasele, who has played twice for Belgium's national team, has reported such posts in the past, but says he has been disappointed by the lack of action from different platforms -- such as Instagram -- on occasion. Following the 2015 incident in Belgium, Kabasele posted a picture of himself with a monkey. He asked in his post if he \"looked like a monkey.\" Kabasele told CNN that Instagram deleted his post, saying the footballer had broken their rules. He also said that he'd been targeted multiple times on the social media account, adding that when he reported the racist posts he was told the platform didn't see it as offensive. \"Racism is not tolerated on Instagram,\" said Facebook, which owns Instagram, in a statement sent to CNN Sport. \"When we find content that breaks our guidelines we will remove it and we will ban those who repeatedly break the rules. \"We invest heavily in new technologies to protect our community and we recently introduced a new safety feature that allows public figures to prevent unwanted contact and control who messages them on Instagram. Instagram did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment as to why it removed Kabasele's post. Twitter had not replied to CNN at the time of publication. Kabasele says whilst education is key to tackling racism, he wants social media companies to do more in holding people responsible for what they post. READ: Cricket star's anger over racist Indian nickname Confronted by fan In addition to comments online, Kabasele provided in graphic detail the racism he has suffered as a player. Having started his professional career in Belgium, the defender moved to Bulgarian club Ludogorets Razgrad in 2011 where he says he experienced racism on multiple occasions. He said almost every away game was marred by \"monkey\" chants or bananas thrown onto the pitch. On one occasion, while waiting for the team bus to depart, he says a fan confronted him and called him a \"f**king N-word\" before walking off with his friends. The Bulgarian Football Union did not immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment, but a Ludogorets Razgrad spokesman said: \"It's very strange for me to read this. Because it's not true. We are a very tolerant nation.\" Kabasele was in his early 20s when he went to play in Bulgaria, but found the experience extremely unsettling. Looking back, he wouldn't again play in Bulgaria given what he went through as a young player there. \"When you see this kind of thing, you understand that people are really closed and they don't want to be open to someone different, somebody from another culture, another country,\" said Kabasele. \"If now you tell me you can go there and work in this kind of country, I will probably say no because I don't want to live this again.\" READ: How the scourge of racism continues to tarnish English football In 2019, Bulgaria was punished with a one-time stadium ban by UEFA for the racist behavior of its fans during a Euro 2020 qualifier against England. As well as the monkey chanting, some Bulgarian spectators made Nazi salutes during the game in October 2019. The president of Bulgaria's football association Borislav Mihaylov stepped down following the game after pressure from the country's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov. Kabasele has continued to report the abuse he's received during his playing career but tries to keep such experiences away from his family, including young children, in order to protect them. However, since moving to England, he's been surprised by the number of racist incidents and says it's an unfortunate trend in Europe at the moment, which he says is fueled by populist politics. \"No I'm not a monkey,\" Kabasele wrote on Instagram in early June. \"No I'm not more stupid than you. Most black people don't finish in jail or become criminals. No i didn't come to your country to steal your jobs, foods, houses etc. I'm a human being just like you. The blood in my body has the same color as yours. \" Since his interview with CNN Sport, Kabasele has publicly backed the Black Lives Matter movement which has gained momentum over recent weeks. \"Don't let anyone close the door of your dreams just because you're black,\" added Kabasele in that Instagram post in early June. \"Don't let anyone silence you and more important keep reporting any racist abuse if you are victim or witness. You are not alone!! Together we will fight to give the same chance to every single human being to succeed in life no matter his skin color. \"It's time to speak up no matter your ethnicity.\" Wilfried Zaha Earlier on Sunday, Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha revealed he had been the target of racial abuse, this time ahead of his side's game in the Premier League against Aston Villa The Palace and Ivory Coast star wrote on Twitter, \"Woke up to this today,\" then showed what he had been sent by a user who appeared to be a Villa fan. \"You better not score tomorrow you black c**t. Or I'll come to your house dressed as a ghost,\" the person wrote. There was an accompanying image of the Ku Klux Klan and a cereal box named, \"c**n flakes.\" READ: Premier League star Zaha racially abused on social media West Midlands Police later announced on Sunday that they have arrested a 12-year-old boy from Solihull after investigating racist messages that were sent to Zaha.   \n",

            "13  Former Australia cricketer Dean Jones has died of cardiac arrest at the age of 59, Indian broadcaster Star India confirmed in a statement on Thursday. Jones, considered to be one of the greatest batsmen of his generation, had been commentating on the Indian Premier League (IPL) in Mumbai and his sudden death prompted tributes from across the world. \"We express our deep condolences to his family and stand ready to support them in this difficult time,\" read the statement from Star India. Jones played 52 Test matches and 164 one-day internationals for Australia in a glittering international career that spanned 10 years. He won the World Cup with his country in 1987 and was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame just last year. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was quick to pay his respects to \"an absolute cricketing legend.\" \"A true entertainer at the crease, whose flair with the bat & electric running between the wickets changed the game forever. A genuine good guy & a huge loss,\" Morrison tweeted, sending his thoughts to Jones' family and friends. READ: Once a homeless street vendor, cricketer signs $327,000 deal Tributes pour in One of Australia's current cricket captain Aaron Finch said he was still in shock after hearing the news and sent his thoughts to those closest to Jones. \"A great man with an amazing passion for the game,\" Finch wrote on Twitter. They were thoughts echoed by Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who said he was greatly saddened by the news. \"A wonderful soul taken away too soon. Had the opportunity to play against him during my first tour of Australia,\" Tendulkar wrote on Twitter. \"May his soul rest in peace and my condolences to his loved ones.\" Jones retired from all forms of cricket in 1998 before embarking on a career as a coach and commentator. Perhaps his most memorable career moment was against India in 1986, when he battled heat exhaustion to record a staggering double century.   \n",

            "2  You can play golf on pristine green courses. You can even play on a course made of ice. But thanks to some innovative thinking, residents of some of the poorest areas of Mumbai have been using the bumps and lumps of the street as their course. Here there's no soundscape of polite clapping from watching fans or birds chirping -- just a cacophony of residents poking their heads out of windows, buses traveling underneath and the hooting of tuk-tuk horns. Slum golf, a version of the game using homemade clubs and balls, deploys the cracks and crevices in the Chembur locality of the hustling, bustling city for its course and small divots in the ground as its holes. The makeshift game was created in 2000 in Mumbai -- India's financial capital with a population of more than 12 million -- by Suresh Mehboobani and others outside their hours working as caddies at the Bombay Presidency Golf Club (BPGC) at a time when they were not permitted to play for free. Golf isn't the most popular sport in India, but Mehboobani is hoping his makeshift version of the sport will prove an introduction -- especially to his 6-year-old daughter Ashmi -- to the more traditional game. \"Everyone likes cricket in India,\" Mehboobani told CNN Sport. \"I [hope] that people watch our videos and they like golf as well. \"People are playing on the streets as well in Europe. Especially people [who] play on the streets, I want people to see our videos on YouTube. The world is playing [golf] on the streets, so that's where I think we did something good; we brought the game to the streets and people like it today.\" READ: Grief over her father's death helped drive golfer Danielle Kang to major success Making the most Although the dark red ball and the wooden bat hook many Indian youngsters, Mehboobani's interest has always been on a small, white ball and long, thin golf clubs. On his route to and from school, he walked past a golf club and after watching through the fence while members drove, chipped and putted, Mehboobani was hooked. He picked up a job at the BPGC caddying to sate his passion for the sport. But when he wasn't permitted to play at the members only club for free, he came up with another method to play, reimagining the Chembur slums as a golf course, with tee positions varying from on the floor to the tops of buildings. After some trial and error, Mehboobani and others found they could use waste material from buildings to fashion clubs -- hammering the end to form the face of the club -- and use cylinder pipes as grips. As for the ball, he insists players use plastic rather than proper golf balls so to not \"draw blood\" if they hit a fellow player, passerby or resident of the slum. In its heyday, over 50 people -- typically caddies at the club -- used to congregate on their days off on Monday to play slum golf. The local club has also opened its arms to slum golf, with some members choosing to try their hand, as well as an Indian professional golfer and an international player traveling to Mumbai to sample this unique version of the game. \"They had a great reaction; they said they are having more fun outside than playing inside (on the course). They get to hit different shots, from above the bus, above cars. Inside you can't hit shots like this; it's all grass, but here you can hit the ball over cars, rooftops.\" However, now that the BPGC has allowed all caddies to play there on a Monday for free, \"slum golf isn't happening much anymore,\" admits Mehboobani. The future Although Mehboobani and his colleagues have found a more traditional locale to play golf, he's still hopeful that slum golf can be an introductory way into a sport which, as he himself knows, can often be inaccessible. His daughter Ashmi is an embodiment of that desire. Mehboobani introduced her to the game when she was just five years old after she saw her father playing on the streets and expressed her interest in \"hitting the ball.\" During the time when the BPGC didn't allow caddies to play on its course and they took up playing on the streets, a video of Ashmi playing golf went viral which, according to her father, was one of the reasons for the BPGC allowing them in. BPGC didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Through her father and her coach, who also runs an academy, she has developed an early love for the game, already adopting Tiger Woods as her idol. Mehboobani is hoping that his daughter's early start on the streets will propel her to success later in her life. \"We [hope] to make her the ladies champion because if the club has supported her this much, she is likely to show good results in the future. She will make the club proud, and she will make the name of her mother and father shine as well.\" It's not just in India where street golf is a thing. In Europe, urban golf was born in the late 1990s when a group of Germans took to the streets of Berlin armed with real balls and clubs and began creating makeshift holes for themselves around the city.

Players might have ultimately chosen the green fairways and greens over the concrete roads and roofs, but slum golf provided them with a taster and opened doors to a sport previously unattainable to many in Mumbai. Once playing from rooftops, these golfers and those who are following them are now shooting for the sky.   \n",

            "28  Margaret Maughan, Great Britain's first Paralympic champion, has died at the age of 91. Maughan won the landmark gold medal in archery at the 1960 Paralympics in Rome and went on to compete at five more Games. She was a strong advocate for the Paralympic movement and lit the cauldron during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Paralympics in London. Following a road accident in Malawi in 1959, Maughan was paralyzed from the waist down. She was treated by Dr. Ludwig Guttmann in the UK, a leading neurologist who founded the Paralympic movement. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features \"We mourn today the loss of one of Great Britain's legends in Paralympic sport with the passing of Margaret Maughan,\" said Nick Webborn, Chair of the British Paralympic Association. \"Although her passing is extremely sad, the fact that she lived until the age of 91 is testament to the work of Sir Ludwig Guttman who transformed the care of people with spinal cord injury, and that through sport people with disabilities can enjoy rich and fulfilling lives.

She also competed in dartchery, a hybrid of darts and archery, in 1972, and lawn bowls in 1980. She won a total of five medals in her career, three gold and two silver. \"On behalf of British Para-Swimming we are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Margaret Maughan,\" said British Para-Swimming's National Performance Director Chris Furber. \"She was a huge inspiration and helped to pave the way for what the Paralympic movement has now become. \"Watching her light the cauldron in London was an incredible moment and she will be sorely missed by everyone involved in para sport.\"   \n",

            "11  Six Pakistani cricket players are in isolation in New Zealand after testing positive for Covid-19, according to New Zealand's national cricket body on Thursday, and the whole squad has been issued with a \"final warning\" after several members were seen breaching rules on isolation. New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said it \"was made aware today that six members of the Pakistan touring squad, currently in managed isolation in Christchurch, have tested positive for COVID-19.\" Four of the cases were new and two of the cases were \"historical,\" the news release added. NZC said all players had tested negative for the virus before departing from Lahore on four separate occasions. \"As a consequence, the Pakistan team's exemption to train while in managed isolation has been put on hold until investigations have been completed,\" NZC said. New Zealand has been widely praised for its approach to handling the coronavirus and has reported just over 2,000 total cases and 25 deaths since the pandemic began, according to the John Hopkins University of Medicine. 'Expected behaviors' Pakistan's official cricket website said the team departed for New Zealand on Monday. After they landed, several of the Pakistani cricket players were caught on camera breaking isolation rules, New Zealand's Ministry of Health said. \"Since their arrival, several team members have been seen on CCTV at the facility breaching managed isolation rules, despite clear, consistent and detailed communication of expected behaviors while in the facility,\" a news release read. \"The team as a whole has been issued with a final warning.\" According to health officials, 53 members of the the squad arrived in Christchurch on 24 November and were tested on day one. \"These cases are the results of those tests,\" the health ministry said. It added that these new cases would be counted outside of its usual daily count because of \"the high public interest in visiting sports teams.\" Those with positive tests are required to stay in quarantine rooms within the facility and no team members are allowed to leave the facility to train. There is no risk to the public as the isolation breaches occurred within the facility, the health department said. In a statement Sunday, the Pakistani cricket team said one player had stayed behind from the trip after reporting a fever, but had previously tested negative for Covid-19. The Pakistani team is expected to play three T20 matches and two Test matches while in New Zealand, with the first match scheduled to take place at Eden Park in Auckland on December 18.   \n",

            "12  Indian cricketing legend Kapil Dev is recovering in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) after suffering a heart attack, a spokesperson for the New Delhi hospital treating him said Friday. The 62-year-old former Indian captain underwent emergency coronary angioplasty surgery, after he was admitted to Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, in the early hours of Friday morning complaining of chest pain. Dev is stable and under supervision in the ICU, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute said in a statement, adding that he is expected to be discharged within a \"couple of days.\" Dev, who captained India to a historic World Cup victory over the West Indies in 1983, is the only player in history to have both taken more than 400 wickets and scored over 5,000 test runs. He has coached the Indian cricket team, worked as a commentator, and more recently has forayed into golf, representing India in a series of amateur tournaments.   \n",

            "10  Football's concussion protocols have been criticized after Arsenal defender David Luiz was allowed to continue playing following a sickening clash of heads with Wolves striker Raul Jimenez in Sunday's Premier League match. Just minutes after returning to the pitch, blood began seeping through the bandage Arsenal medical staff had wrapped around Luiz's head. After the match Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said that Luiz was substituted at halftime because he felt \"uncomfortable heading the ball.\" Wolves confirmed on Monday that Jimenez underwent successful surgery on a fractured skull. Arteta insisted that the doctors \"made all the tests and followed all the protocols\" to ensure it was safe for Luiz to continue and said the Brazilian never lost consciousness. However, Headway, a UK charity that works to improve life after brain injury, said in a statement after the match that loss of consciousness is a factor in only 10% of all concussion cases. \"We have repeatedly warned about the risks to players and the importance of elite-level sport setting a good example for impressionable younger players to follow,\" said Luke Griggs, Deputy Chief Executive at Headway. \"Too often in football, we see players returning to the pitch having undergone a concussion assessment -- only to be withdrawn a few minutes later when it is clear that they are not fit to continue. READ: International football's concussion protocols 'are the worst in the world' \"That is the very reason why we urgently need temporary concussion substitutes in football. You simply cannot take a risk with head injuries. \"They are not like muscular injuries where you can put a player back on 'to see if they can run it off.' One further blow to the head when concussed could have serious consequences.\" 'Archaic' Football's concussion protocols have increasingly come under the spotlight in recent years. While other sports such as rugby, cricket and American football have adapted their rules to allow temporary substitutions, which ensure players with head injuries can be properly assessed for concussion, football's protocols in May 2019 were described by Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, as \"archaic\" and \"the worst in the world.\" In October of last year, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) -- the organization responsible for \"preserving and developing\" the rules of the game -- held a meeting in Zurich to discuss football's protocols, notably the addition of a temporary substitute to allow for a 10-minute concussion assessment window instead of the current three-minute test. IFAB decided an expert group should be tasked with finding a solution taking into account \"both player welfare and the need to ensure sporting fairness,\" it said in a statement at the time. More than 13 months later, however, IFAB said in a November statement that the \"main proposed principles\" for additional substitutions submitted by its Concussion Expert Group will \"be explored further\" and that trials could begin in January. \"The IFAB takes head injuries in football matches very seriously as protecting the health of players is -- and will remain -- a top priority in developing the Laws of the Game,\" an IFAB spokesperson told CNN. \"The IFAB has made tackling this issue a key objective and has established a Concussion Expert Group that has discussed and evaluated research on the topic of concussion and head injuries. \"Given the very complex nature of this topic, it has been clear from the beginning that concrete decisions related to the Laws of the Game must be well thought through and examined from all different stakeholder perspectives (medical concussion experts, team doctors, player representatives, coaches, competition organizers, refereeing and Laws of the Game experts, etc.).\" IFAB says detailed protocols regarding additional permanent concussions substitutions are currently being finalized and will be considered by IFAB's board of directors at a December 16 meeting. The board will decide whether extensive trials will be approved for January 2021. The English Football Association (FA) said it \"welcomes\" and \"will support\" the proposed trials of an additional permanent concussion substitution. \"Player welfare is paramount and we believe that this is an important step to help support players, clubs and medical teams when identifying and managing head injuries and incidents of concussion during a game,\" an FA spokesperson said on Twitter. However, FIFPro -- the worldwide representative organization for professional footballers -- doesn't believe permanent substitutions are the right way forward and would instead prefer temporary substitutions. \"We have pushed for the trial of temporary substitutions, as you see in Rugby Union, for instance, and this trial was not well received,\" Dr. Vincent Gouttebarge, FIFPro's chief medical officer, told Sky. \"At present times, they want to try first permanent concussion substitutions. \"Again, it is a move forward, but nevertheless I don't think we are going to solve the problem with this permanent substitution because it does not provide the medical team with sufficient time to assess on field and off field the player's potential concussion. \"I hope that football stakeholders will not have to wait [for] a very high profile case with a very severe consequence in order to move forward. \"Football is perhaps one of the sports that is most conservative in terms of advancements, by comparison to other sports. We would have preferred to see some measures applied yesterday rather than tomorrow.\" The Premier League has previously said it wants to be involved in the trial and is waiting on the full IFAB proposal to make a decision on the next steps. \"The question that has to be asked is had the concussion substitutes rule been in place, would Luiz have been allowed to return to the field of play?\" added Headway's Griggs. \"Would that extra time in the treatment room have led to a different decision being made? \"The concussion protocol clearly states that ... 'anyone with a suspected concussion must be immediately removed from play', while the sport continues to promote an 'if in doubt, sit it out' approach to head injuries. \"Time and time again we are seeing this rhetoric not being borne out by actions on the pitch. Something is not right. This cannot be allowed to continue. How many warnings does football need?\"   \n",

            "35  The man responsible for racially abusing England cricketer Jofra Archer in New Zealand has been handed a two-year ban from attending international and domestic cricket matches in the country. Archer said he heard the abuse as he walked back to the pavilion during the final day of the first Test between the sides at the Bay Oval cricket ground, a fixture that England went one to lose by an innings and 65 runs. The Barbados-born fast bowler took to Twitter at the time to voice his thoughts on the incident which he described as \"a bit disturbing\" and subsequently filed a complaint with Tauranga police. The police interviewed a 28-year man from Auckland who admitted the abuse. Archer reportedly received a message on Instagram from the man which the English Cricket Board passed on to New Zealand Cricket (NZC), although it is unclear whether this message was an apology or further racial abuse. The man was issued with a verbal warning from the police for using insulting language but no further action was taken. NZC have since written to the man informing him of his two-year ban from attending fixtures, which will last until 2022. Anthony Crummy, a spokesperson for NZC has warned that if the man breaches the ban he could face further police action. He once again passed on apologies on behalf of the country: \"We'd again like to extend our apologies to Jofra and the England team management for such an unsavory incident and reiterate once more that this type of behavior is completely unacceptable.\" England are currently in the middle of a four-match Test series in South Africa, but following the incident New Zealand captain Kane Williamson apologized directly to Archer for the incident, describing the abuse as \"horrific\". NZC have since taken additional action to ensure incidents of racist abuse do not happen again. Anti-racist messages will be signposted around cricket grounds, as well as on screens and delivered by on-ground announcers. The governing body also encouraged spectators to use a text alert system to inform ground security of anti-social behavior, including racist abuse.   \n",

            "28  Margaret Maughan, Great Britain's first Paralympic champion, has died at the age of 91. Maughan won the landmark gold medal in archery at the 1960 Paralympics in Rome and went on to compete at five more Games. She was a strong advocate for the Paralympic movement and lit the cauldron during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Paralympics in London. Following a road accident in Malawi in 1959, Maughan was paralyzed from the waist down. She was treated by Dr. Ludwig Guttmann in the UK, a leading neurologist who founded the Paralympic movement. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features \"We mourn today the loss of one of Great Britain's legends in Paralympic sport with the passing of Margaret Maughan,\" said Nick Webborn, Chair of the British Paralympic Association. \"Although her passing is extremely sad, the fact that she lived until the age of 91 is testament to the work of Sir Ludwig Guttman who transformed the care of people with spinal cord injury, and that through sport people with disabilities can enjoy rich and fulfilling lives.

She also competed in dartchery, a hybrid of darts and archery, in 1972, and lawn bowls in 1980. She won a total of five medals in her career, three gold and two silver. \"On behalf of British Para-Swimming we are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Margaret Maughan,\" said British Para-Swimming's National Performance Director Chris Furber. \"She was a huge inspiration and helped to pave the way for what the Paralympic movement has now become. \"Watching her light the cauldron in London was an incredible moment and she will be sorely missed by everyone involved in para sport.\"   \n",

            "11  Six Pakistani cricket players are in isolation in New Zealand after testing positive for Covid-19, according to New Zealand's national cricket body on Thursday, and the whole squad has been issued with a \"final warning\" after several members were seen breaching rules on isolation. New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said it \"was made aware today that six members of the Pakistan touring squad, currently in managed isolation in Christchurch, have tested positive for COVID-19.\" Four of the cases were new and two of the cases were \"historical,\" the news release added. NZC said all players had tested negative for the virus before departing from Lahore on four separate occasions. \"As a consequence, the Pakistan team's exemption to train while in managed isolation has been put on hold until investigations have been completed,\" NZC said. New Zealand has been widely praised for its approach to handling the coronavirus and has reported just over 2,000 total cases and 25 deaths since the pandemic began, according to the John Hopkins University of Medicine. 'Expected behaviors' Pakistan's official cricket website said the team departed for New Zealand on Monday. After they landed, several of the Pakistani cricket players were caught on camera breaking isolation rules, New Zealand's Ministry of Health said. \"Since their arrival, several team members have been seen on CCTV at the facility breaching managed isolation rules, despite clear, consistent and detailed communication of expected behaviors while in the facility,\" a news release read. \"The team as a whole has been issued with a final warning.\" According to health officials, 53 members of the the squad arrived in Christchurch on 24 November and were tested on day one. \"These cases are the results of those tests,\" the health ministry said. It added that these new cases would be counted outside of its usual daily count because of \"the high public interest in visiting sports teams.\" Those with positive tests are required to stay in quarantine rooms within the facility and no team members are allowed to leave the facility to train. There is no risk to the public as the isolation breaches occurred within the facility, the health department said. In a statement Sunday, the Pakistani cricket team said one player had stayed behind from the trip after reporting a fever, but had previously tested negative for Covid-19. The Pakistani team is expected to play three T20 matches and two Test matches while in New Zealand, with the first match scheduled to take place at Eden Park in Auckland on December 18.   \n",

            "12  Indian cricketing legend Kapil Dev is recovering in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) after suffering a heart attack, a spokesperson for the New Delhi hospital treating him said Friday. The 62-year-old former Indian captain underwent emergency coronary angioplasty surgery, after he was admitted to Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, in the early hours of Friday morning complaining of chest pain. Dev is stable and under supervision in the ICU, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute said in a statement, adding that he is expected to be discharged within a \"couple of days.\" Dev, who captained India to a historic World Cup victory over the West Indies in 1983, is the only player in history to have both taken more than 400 wickets and scored over 5,000 test runs. He has coached the Indian cricket team, worked as a commentator, and more recently has forayed into golf, representing India in a series of amateur tournaments.   \n",

            "10  Football's concussion protocols have been criticized after Arsenal defender David Luiz was allowed to continue playing following a sickening clash of heads with Wolves striker Raul Jimenez in Sunday's Premier League match. Just minutes after returning to the pitch, blood began seeping through the bandage Arsenal medical staff had wrapped around Luiz's head. After the match Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said that Luiz was substituted at halftime because he felt \"uncomfortable heading the ball.\" Wolves confirmed on Monday that Jimenez underwent successful surgery on a fractured skull. Arteta insisted that the doctors \"made all the tests and followed all the protocols\" to ensure it was safe for Luiz to continue and said the Brazilian never lost consciousness. However, Headway, a UK charity that works to improve life after brain injury, said in a statement after the match that loss of consciousness is a factor in only 10% of all concussion cases. \"We have repeatedly warned about the risks to players and the importance of elite-level sport setting a good example for impressionable younger players to follow,\" said Luke Griggs, Deputy Chief Executive at Headway. \"Too often in football, we see players returning to the pitch having undergone a concussion assessment -- only to be withdrawn a few minutes later when it is clear that they are not fit to continue. READ: International football's concussion protocols 'are the worst in the world' \"That is the very reason why we urgently need temporary concussion substitutes in football. You simply cannot take a risk with head injuries. \"They are not like muscular injuries where you can put a player back on 'to see if they can run it off.' One further blow to the head when concussed could have serious consequences.\" 'Archaic' Football's concussion protocols have increasingly come under the spotlight in recent years. While other sports such as rugby, cricket and American football have adapted their rules to allow temporary substitutions, which ensure players with head injuries can be properly assessed for concussion, football's protocols in May 2019 were described by Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, as \"archaic\" and \"the worst in the world.\" In October of last year, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) -- the organization responsible for \"preserving and developing\" the rules of the game -- held a meeting in Zurich to discuss football's protocols, notably the addition of a temporary substitute to allow for a 10-minute concussion assessment window instead of the current three-minute test. IFAB decided an expert group should be tasked with finding a solution taking into account \"both player welfare and the need to ensure sporting fairness,\" it said in a statement at the time. More than 13 months later, however, IFAB said in a November statement that the \"main proposed principles\" for additional substitutions submitted by its Concussion Expert Group will \"be explored further\" and that trials could begin in January. \"The IFAB takes head injuries in football matches very seriously as protecting the health of players is -- and will remain -- a top priority in developing the Laws of the Game,\" an IFAB spokesperson told CNN. \"The IFAB has made tackling this issue a key objective and has established a Concussion Expert Group that has discussed and evaluated research on the topic of concussion and head injuries. \"Given the very complex nature of this topic, it has been clear from the beginning that concrete decisions related to the Laws of the Game must be well thought through and examined from all different stakeholder perspectives (medical concussion experts, team doctors, player representatives, coaches, competition organizers, refereeing and Laws of the Game experts, etc.).\" IFAB says detailed protocols regarding additional permanent concussions substitutions are currently being finalized and will be considered by IFAB's board of directors at a December 16 meeting. The board will decide whether extensive trials will be approved for January 2021. The English Football Association (FA) said it \"welcomes\" and \"will support\" the proposed trials of an additional permanent concussion substitution. \"Player welfare is paramount and we believe that this is an important step to help support players, clubs and medical teams when identifying and managing head injuries and incidents of concussion during a game,\" an FA spokesperson said on Twitter. However, FIFPro -- the worldwide representative organization for professional footballers -- doesn't believe permanent substitutions are the right way forward and would instead prefer temporary substitutions. \"We have pushed for the trial of temporary substitutions, as you see in Rugby Union, for instance, and this trial was not well received,\" Dr. Vincent Gouttebarge, FIFPro's chief medical officer, told Sky. \"At present times, they want to try first permanent concussion substitutions. \"Again, it is a move forward, but nevertheless I don't think we are going to solve the problem with this permanent substitution because it does not provide the medical team with sufficient time to assess on field and off field the player's potential concussion. \"I hope that football stakeholders will not have to wait [for] a very high profile case with a very severe consequence in order to move forward. \"Football is perhaps one of the sports that is most conservative in terms of advancements, by comparison to other sports. We would have preferred to see some measures applied yesterday rather than tomorrow.\" The Premier League has previously said it wants to be involved in the trial and is waiting on the full IFAB proposal to make a decision on the next steps. \"The question that has to be asked is had the concussion substitutes rule been in place, would Luiz have been allowed to return to the field of play?\" added Headway's Griggs. \"Would that extra time in the treatment room have led to a different decision being made? \"The concussion protocol clearly states that ... 'anyone with a suspected concussion must be immediately removed from play', while the sport continues to promote an 'if in doubt, sit it out' approach to head injuries. \"Time and time again we are seeing this rhetoric not being borne out by actions on the pitch. Something is not right. This cannot be allowed to continue. How many warnings does football need?\"   \n",

            "35  The man responsible for racially abusing England cricketer Jofra Archer in New Zealand has been handed a two-year ban from attending international and domestic cricket matches in the country. Archer said he heard the abuse as he walked back to the pavilion during the final day of the first Test between the sides at the Bay Oval cricket ground, a fixture that England went one to lose by an innings and 65 runs. The Barbados-born fast bowler took to Twitter at the time to voice his thoughts on the incident which he described as \"a bit disturbing\" and subsequently filed a complaint with Tauranga police. The police interviewed a 28-year man from Auckland who admitted the abuse. Archer reportedly received a message on Instagram from the man which the English Cricket Board passed on to New Zealand Cricket (NZC), although it is unclear whether this message was an apology or further racial abuse. The man was issued with a verbal warning from the police for using insulting language but no further action was taken. NZC have since written to the man informing him of his two-year ban from attending fixtures, which will last until 2022. Anthony Crummy, a spokesperson for NZC has warned that if the man breaches the ban he could face further police action. He once again passed on apologies on behalf of the country: \"We'd again like to extend our apologies to Jofra and the England team management for such an unsavory incident and reiterate once more that this type of behavior is completely unacceptable.\" England are currently in the middle of a four-match Test series in South Africa, but following the incident New Zealand captain Kane Williamson apologized directly to Archer for the incident, describing the abuse as \"horrific\". NZC have since taken additional action to ensure incidents of racist abuse do not happen again. Anti-racist messages will be signposted around cricket grounds, as well as on screens and delivered by on-ground announcers. The governing body also encouraged spectators to use a text alert system to inform ground security of anti-social behavior, including racist abuse.   \n",

            "13  Former Australia cricketer Dean Jones has died of cardiac arrest at the age of 59, Indian broadcaster Star India confirmed in a statement on Thursday. Jones, considered to be one of the greatest batsmen of his generation, had been commentating on the Indian Premier League (IPL) in Mumbai and his sudden death prompted tributes from across the world. \"We express our deep condolences to his family and stand ready to support them in this difficult time,\" read the statement from Star India. Jones played 52 Test matches and 164 one-day internationals for Australia in a glittering international career that spanned 10 years. He won the World Cup with his country in 1987 and was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame just last year. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was quick to pay his respects to \"an absolute cricketing legend.\" \"A true entertainer at the crease, whose flair with the bat & electric running between the wickets changed the game forever. A genuine good guy & a huge loss,\" Morrison tweeted, sending his thoughts to Jones' family and friends. READ: Once a homeless street vendor, cricketer signs $327,000 deal Tributes pour in One of Australia's current cricket captain Aaron Finch said he was still in shock after hearing the news and sent his thoughts to those closest to Jones. \"A great man with an amazing passion for the game,\" Finch wrote on Twitter. They were thoughts echoed by Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who said he was greatly saddened by the news. \"A wonderful soul taken away too soon. Had the opportunity to play against him during my first tour of Australia,\" Tendulkar wrote on Twitter. \"May his soul rest in peace and my condolences to his loved ones.\" Jones retired from all forms of cricket in 1998 before embarking on a career as a coach and commentator. Perhaps his most memorable career moment was against India in 1986, when he battled heat exhaustion to record a staggering double century.   \n",

            "14  A typical young adult, donned in a pink and purple club jersey, with long limbs and a sprouting mustache, Yashasvi Jaiswal quickly runs his fingers through his hair. The words of wisdom that follow belie his 18 years. The teenager has experienced more of life's ups and downs than many young men his age. His is certainly a rags to riches story fit for the silver screen. Having left home aged eight to fulfill his dreams of becoming a professional cricket player in Mumbai, Jaiswal slept in a tent on a cricket ground while sustaining himself as a street vendor before his talent was finally spotted. Now, the teenager has secured a deal worth more than $300,000 with Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket team Rajasthan Royals. \"Believe in yourself -- that's key,\" he tells CNN as he could be set to make his IPL debut. \"Work hard. When you leave the cricket ground and go home and sit on your bed, you should feel you've learned something.\" After delays and venue changes due to Covid-19, the forthcoming IPL season -- the richest club-based league in the world -- commences on Saturday in the United Arab Emirates, with eight teams, each named after cities in India, competing. Zubin Bharucha, director of cricket for the Royals, first spotted Jaiswal at the team trials about three years ago. \"He walked across the stumps and flicked it over fine leg for four, and all of us just stopped, stared and wondered. There was something really special here,\" Bharucha tells CNN. At the time, the inexperienced Jaiswal was not signed, but years later the franchise would come back for the left-handed batsman. Dreaming big Jasiwal was three years old when he was first handed a cricket bat by his father, Bhupendra Jaiswal, an amateur cricketer who was keen to encourage his son's passion for one of the country's most popular sports. Growing up, his hero was Sachin Tendulkar and, like the great batsman, Jaiswal wanted to play for Mumbai and, of course, his country. Aged eight, he left the family home with his father for Mumbai, commonly referred to as the city of dreams, and initially the pair stayed in a relative's house. \"It's really difficult to live in a small house with six to seven people. It was hard to live with them,\" the young cricketer recalls. As his father, an owner of a small paint shop in the village, didn't have the means to support his son financially in the city, Jaiswal soon realized he would have to work, and play cricket, to survive. He left his uncle's home and moved into a dairy shop, working long hours there while also practicing cricket at a famous ground in South Mumbai -- a hub for aspiring cricketers. But, just as he was becoming accustomed to his new routine, he was told to leave the shop. \"I asked for time till the next morning. I had nowhere to go,\" says Jaiswal. His coach provided the homeless Jaiswal with a place to stay for about three months before a tent at a cricket field with groundsmen became somewhere he would rest his head at night. \"I thought I had a great chance living near a cricket ground. I could practice more than anyone else,\" Jaiswal says. Finally, the tide turns Unwilling to tell his family about his daily struggles in case they would ask him to return to the village, sleeping hungry became the new reality. \"I slowly realized it was really hard to live there. There was no electricity, no water, no food. You had to make your own food. At that time, my parents couldn't afford much,\" he explains. To make ends meet, Jaiswal started selling food as a street vendor and did so for three years until the tide turned. In December 2013, a then 12-year-old Jaiswal was practicing in the nets when he was spotted by cricket coach, Jwala Singh. \"He was batting well against senior fast bowlers. His story was unique,\" Singh, who had also moved to Mumbai at a young age to pursue his cricketing dream, tells CNN. A week later, Singh tested the boy's skills at his own cricket academy and the rest is history. Not only did Singh take the boy under his wing, but he also provided him with accommodation. Jaiswal still lives with Singh's family. With a roof over his head, and a professional coach to guide him, Jaiswal's focus turned only to the game. In 2015, under Singh's tutelage, Jaiswal participated in the Giles Shield cricket tournament -- an inter-school cricket tournament in Mumbai. It was in this series that he scored a triple century in a match and scalped 13 wickets. An all-round record in school cricket, his feat was captured in India's Limca Book of Records. Coincidentally, it was on the same day that Jaiswal's father visited Mumbai to take him back to the village. Singh says the young cricketer's big score, and an assurance from him, altered the father's decision. The moment of reckoning Singh realized his student needed more than just routine practice on cricket grounds, so he would occasionally take Jaiswal to meet established cricketers, once meeting former Indian cricketer Wasim Jaffer. \"Jaffer told Yashasvi that making runs is a habit, playing longer innings is an art. That is what people will remember you for,\" Singh says, pointing out that Jaffer's insight is a key reason why Yashasvi has scored over 62 centuries to date. Awards and praise followed. Jaiswal was selected for Mumbai's under-16 squad and then India Under-19s. He made his debut in the 50-over format in September 2019 for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Jaiswal literally knocked the ball out of the stadium while playing against the team from Jharkhand state. The batsman scored 203 off 154, making him the youngest double centurion in the history of the 50-over game, List-A Cricket. And then came another moment of reckoning. The boy who came to Mumbai with nothing but a big dream was selected in India's squad for the 2020 Under-19 World Cup. Before he left for the much-anticipated series, the IPL auctions took place on December 19, 2019. Jaiswal was listed at a base price of $27,000 but was bought at 12 times the amount -- a staggering $327,000 - by the 2008 IPL champion. \"It was pretty normal since I had a good domestic season. My parents and sister were very excited. It was a good moment,\" he says of the price tag. Jake Lush McCrum, the Royals' chief operating officer, vividly remembers the first time he met Jaiswal: \"I had been in India for a few months at that point and I was just taken aback to be honest ... He had such a challenging start, but what he's overcome is immense, and how humble he is.\" It's rare for a cricketer of Jasiwal's age to share a dressing room with cricket stars like England internationals, and Royals teammates, Jofra Archer, Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes This village boy's ultimate dream is to wear India's senior team cricket jersey someday. \"I just want to play cricket as much as I can. I really love it,\" he says.   \n",

            "23  The cricket world is in mourning after West Indies cricket legend Everton Weekes died at the age of 95. He was one of the \"Three Ws\" -- along with Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott -- who put Barbados and West Indies cricket on the map in the 1950s. It is expected that he will be buried alongside Worrell and Walcott, who died in 1967 and 2006 respectively, at the Three Ws Stadium on the University of the West Indies' Cave Hill Campus in Barbados where a plot has been left vacant for Weekes. Cricket West Indies paid tribute to Weekes, tweeting: \"Our hearts are heavy as we mourn the loss of an icon. A legend, our hero, Sir Everton Weekes. Our hearts are heavy as we mourn the loss of an icon. A legend, our hero, Sir Everton Weekes. Weekes made his Test debut at the age of just 22 during England's 1947-48 tour of the Caribbean. That same year, he became the first batsman to score five Test centuries in consecutive innings -- a record that stands to this day. The record might have been six consecutive centuries had he not been run out for 90 in Madras. Weekes' relatively diminutive stature rarely stopped him from dominating opposition bowling attacks. When named by Wisden as one of its five Cricketers of the Year in 1950, it was written that \"Weekes possessed in full measure those gifts which are the hallmark of all really great batsmen -- exceptional quickness of eye and foot,\" adding that \"many bowlers must have been astonished at the speed with which the ball hurtled straight back past him.\" It was predicted that Weekes would continue to perform and deliver for the West Indies side, and indeed he did. He finished his international playing career in 1958 having amassed 4,455 Test runs at an average of 58.61 and 15 centuries. Weekes' average remains in the top 10 career averages for a player with more than 4,000 runs. Race and Barriers Weekes was born into a world still rife with systemic and societal racism. As a 13-year old, Weekes began playing for Westshire Cricket Club in the Barbados Cricket League as his local club Pickwick catered only to white players. Batting places were predominantly reserved for lighter-skinned players, but such was Weekes' ability that he forced his way into the Barbados team at 18. Even after his illustrious playing career was over Weekes faced discrimation. Trevor Chesterfield recounts in an essay entitled 'Zimbabwe Cricket: A Challenge almost Won' in the book \"Cricketing Cultures in Conflict: Cricketing World Cup 2003\" that Weekes was a target of racism during a 1967 exhibition tour of the then-named Rhodesia. On a travel day, Weekes joined his white teammates for a drink at a Gwelo bar but was individually told on arrival, \"Get out, you know where your bar is.\" Weekes and former West Indies teammate Rohan Kanhai threatened to abandon the tour but remained after an apology from officials in government. The discrimination didn't stop there and, although Weekes was said to be a mild-mannered and quiet person, he was unafraid to stand up to racism. While denied by officials at the time, a game against a local side in Gwelo -- now known as Gweru in Zimbabwe -- was moved from a ground in the white area to a substandard ground in the black area due to Weekes' and Kanhai's presence in the touring side. A white local approached the Bajan great before the game, barking: \"Say you there ... Weekes, I know you're going to give us a first-class performance, aren't you?\" all while wagging his finger. The then-42-year old replied: \"Well, as this is a second-class venue, it'll be a second-class performance.\" Weekes proceeded to purposefully top-edge his first ball and walked off without waiting to see if he had been caught out. Present day Weekes suffered a heart attack in June last year but rallied to see his 95th birthday in February this year. The current West Indies side arrived in England at the beginning of June for a three-Test series set to begin on July 8. It has been announced that both England and the West Indies will sport the Black Lives Matter logo on their shirts during the series. Both teams are wearing black armbands today during their respective intra-squad warm-up matches to honor Weekes, with the West Indies also holding a minute's silence before play.   \n",

            "41  Pakistan will play a home Test cricket match for the first time in 10 years after announcing a two-game series against Sri Lanka in December. The country has not hosted a Test match -- a game which takes place over five days -- since the Sri Lankan cricket team's bus was attacked in Lahore in 2009. Six Pakistani policeman and two civilians were killed when 12 gunmen opened fire on the bus carrying the Sri Lankan team to the stadium. Seven Sri Lankan players -- including star batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene -- were injured.

The remaining uninjured players were evacuated from Gaddafi Stadium by a Pakistani air force helicopter. \"This is a fabulous news for Pakistan cricket and its reputation of being as safe and secure as any other country in the world,\" Zakir Khan, the Pakistan Cricket Board's director of international cricket, said. \"We are thankful to Sri Lanka Cricket for agreeing to send their team for the longer version of the game, which will contribute significantly in the PCB's efforts and drive for regular resumption of international cricket and help in its endeavors of attracting new audiences and younger generation.\" Originally, Pakistan was scheduled to play Tests against Sri Lanka in October and then return in December for shorter-forms of the game. But these were swapped to allow the security situation to be assessed before deciding the home venues. There were fears the tour would have to be moved from Pakistan completely, after Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) released a statement saying it had received \"reliable information of a possible terrorist threat\" against the national squad After a successful white-ball cricket tour, Pakistan's two home Tests were confirmed. The first Test will take place in Rawalpindi from December 11-15, with the second being held in Karachi from December 19-23. They will be a part of the new World Test Championship. Pakistan has been playing most of its 'home' Test series in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates since the 2009 attack.

Since 2009, 14 T20s and five one-day internationals have been staged in the country. SLC chief executive Ashley de Silva said: \"We are pleased to confirm our return visit to Pakistan as, based on our earlier visit, we are comfortable and convinced conditions are suitable and conducive for Test cricket. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos \"We also believe all cricket playing countries should host international cricket at home and in this relation, we are happy to play our part in complete resumption of international cricket in Pakistan, which not only has a proud history but has been one of our biggest supporters in our early days as a cricket nation.\"   \n",
